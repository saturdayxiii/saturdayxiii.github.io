<h2 id="my-girlfriend-flies-away-from-me">My Girlfriend Flies Away from Me</h2>

<p>     My girlfriend has gone on vacation with her family for 5 days.  This should be a very normal thing and many people seem to congratulate me on some kind of freedom, but I don’t feel that way.</p>

<p>    I’ve got anxiety issues.  I’ve had them for longer than I’ve known her.  It’s the kind of anxiety that I used to get as a child when I knew that I was going to the doctor to get a needle.  It sticks between my stomach and my heart and often overflows into tears.  While I eventually learned to keep my cool until the shot was done and I didn’t have to worry about being scared of it anymore, these days I don’t know when the anxiety will be finished.  Yes, my girlfriend is coming home.  I talk to her every day and she tells me “I’ll be home soon”.  It’s true, she will be, I will feel better, but the words and the comfort just seems to float through me and I’m still scared. </p>

<p>     I’m not writing this to complain, I’m not trying to boast about my problems.  I just feel better when I write.  Like maybe I can understand what’s going on if I can break it down just right.</p>

<p>     I don’t know the root of my anxiety.  I blame it on different fundamental problems and I’m trying to narrow down what exactly is the cause.  Overworked?  Too much free time?  Bad social habits?  Loneliness?  I don’t know.  I probably never will or at least the reason will keep changing.</p>

<p>     This week I watched my girlfriend fly away from me and it bothers me.  This is the third time in the last 9 months that she’s done this.  She hasn’t done it willingly and I’m not blaming anyone.  Things just happen and it’s always logical that she leaves without me. </p>

<p>     What I think bothers me about this is the fact that I’ve only flown 4 times in my life.  It’s not an issue with quantity but three times now she’s flown away from me and it bothers me.  She tells me apologetically that soon we’ll go places together.  I want that but even that isn’t the issue.</p>

<p>     That will be great but right now I think what’s bothering me is how I feel so left behind. Not specifically because of this event but maybe it’s a more difficult and extreme feeling since I have a week to dwell on it alone.  I feel like a kid that was standing in line while my peer captains picked teams and rather than being the last kid picked; I wasn’t acknowledged at all and the game started without me.  I’m right here but things keep happening without me and it feels like I’m the only one left alone.</p>

<p>    Right now I think I’d feel better if I were the one getting on the plane and she was the one who had to miss me.  There’s something wrong with this.  Not just the fact that I’d rather her suffer this way, this time, there’s something logically wrong with it.  I know she misses me right now, she tells me and I know it’s true.  I want to think that if our physical positions were changed, so will our emotional ones.</p>

<p>     Realistically though, if I were on the plane and she stayed behind, she would miss me, exactly how she does now.  She’ll carry on and she’ll miss me.  If I was on a plane; I’d be anxious and scared, trying to write my feelings out because it bothers me.</p>
