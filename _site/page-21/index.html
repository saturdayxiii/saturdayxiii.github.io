I was not expecting to enjoy the second season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Mississippi_(TV_series)" target="_blank">One Mississippi</a> as much as I did.  The first season was alright, something to have on while I concentrated on another task.  It started strong on the topic of loss, and the whole show is caked with bitter wit.  However, I thought the “mom’s not as perfect as we thought” bit was rather played; they didn’t even bring it up again in later episodes, and I really didn’t know what they were trying to do with the child molestation aspects.

This carried over into the beginning of the second season.  I thought it was just something dramatic that they were going to dangle in front of the audience when they couldn’t think of anything else.  I was relieved that they seemed to have other ideas on the go for this season.  Which consisted mostly of gushy junior high love stuff as all of our main character seeked companionship.  That’s a big red flag for my biasness because I’m a total sucker for junior high lovey-doveness.  

There’s a great mix of characters from all walks of life with strong personalities, and I love seeing them conflict then actually strive to accommodate each other.  The characters are actively interested in learning about each other and that is extremely refreshing.  By the end when the child molestation point was brought back, every character had some kind of struggle that tied into the analogy and it was displayed very intricate and delicately.

Unfortunately Tig reminds me a lot of Brent Butt when he always seemed to star in shows that saw his character getting together with the cast’s most eligible bachelorette, but I’m now willing to bet that the writers are aware of this and will use this to further the story magnificently.

Google Play recommended <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pinestreetcodeworks.TinyBubbles" target="_blank">Tiny Bubbles</a>.  It looked nice and boasted a bunch of “awards”, so I figured I’d give it a shot.  I later uninstalled with a resounding “meh”.

It had good mechanics and nice animation, but I played like 20 some levels and they were extremely tutorial-y.  Despite the mechanics constantly evolving the challenge remained nearly non-existent.  Or maybe remembering all the game variations across stages was supposed to be the challenge?  Things might have worked themselves out with more play, and there were good things on the horizon like arcade and puzzle modes, but the ads were taking hold.  Buy this, look at that, refill your energy.  Notification!  Notification.

Sorry, but too little, too late; uninstalled.  I’m sure there are people that would enjoy this game a lot, it certainly didn’t seem too bad, but I don’t want to develop a tolerance for this kind of spam.  I didn’t even look at how much they were asking to play unhindered.  Someone else can experiment, I’ve got other things to play.<br /><br />

I watched most of the waking hours of AGDQ this year.  I have a growing disinterest that I assume is coming from over-familiarity.  But my favorite part, which challenged that notion, was the <a href="https://youtu.be/Gcbhkqub6ZI" target="_blank">legend of Zelda: Link to the Past</a> segment.  It was a positive experience with a lot of close calls.  I also enjoyed the <a href="https://youtu.be/rbyV3MCR9xk" target="_blank">super Metroid</a> finale.  Maybe it just took me all week to get into it?
