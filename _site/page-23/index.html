      <p>
      
        <img src="https://saturdayxiii.github.io/media/181881333409.png" />

The cute characters, shiny art, and exploration premise drew me into watching Made in Abyss season one; I have no other experience with this title.
I understand that it’s a pretty well loved show.  I can see why, but after having watched it I don’t understand why.  If I wasn’t aware of its popularity I’d tell the uninitiated that it’s a pretty show, but definitely not a “must see”.  However, knowing that it’s considered the “best anime of 2017″ makes me want to recommend… that people pay attention to how bad it is.  The fact that shows like this are considered the “best” is why I rarely watch anime anymore.  Made in Abyss definitely contributes to my list of reasons to not like anime.
I will grant that the artwork, music, and premise are fantastic, but these three things do not a complete anime make.  It’s possible that the manga could be phenomenal, and the premise is strong enough that I’d be interested in reading it, but I’m talking about the anime here because that’s what my media circles share with me.  I’ve repeatedly heard the show described as “fantastic”, but the one word review I’d give it is “gross”.
I’m aware that “gross” is a very subjective term and maybe doesn’t reflect quality, but I really think that should be the first thing that people notice when watching this show.  Watch for how gross it is.  Specifically?  I’m going to make my number one issue to do with child sexuality.  It’s honestly not something that’s at the forefront of the show, and I think many people over look it because, hey, it’s Japan; we’ve seen worse.  But it’s actually sprinkled pretty heavily throughout the show.  It also has next to nothing to do with our story, except maybe our budding protagonists are developing romantic feelings for each other, but it seems pretty obvious that this stuff isn’t in the show for development sake.
Our main characters are 12 years old (though I thought there were 8 by their designs) and at the first minute mark of the first episode we get a mention of the main character being “strung up naked” as a punishment for something. Okay… That’s odd, and very tonally out of place in our fun childrens adventure.  Even odder is that they frame it as some kind of a gag that our hero is over reacting to as her company looks disinterested.  Then it becomes straight up creepy when this gag reoccurs throughout the series even with different characters.  Like this wondrous fantastical world is meant to draw you in and entice you, and hey also child abuse is a staple here, neat huh?  It’s one thing if this kind of situation is used as a plot point or even some kind of commentary, then there’s a possibility that its use could be redeemed with context, but no.  It doesn’t even drive any of our characters actions.  It’s paced and stylized to get a rise out of the audience, nothing more.  
Combine that with the times that our otherwise attentive main character forgets to put on clothes, and repeated references to the deuteragonist‘s penis, and characters pleas of feeling violated being regularly ignored, and the main char having her legs pulled apart to administer medicine that “can’t be take orally”, and yah, uh, the show is gross.  And that’s not even the physically gross stuff.  I mean like animals being sliced open, guts being pulled out, unsuccessful limb amputation, vomit, urine, human silly puddy??  And they tell you that once you go so far into the Abyss, you’re going to bleed out of all your orifices.  They tell you this, and by golly they are going to show it.  Here it is!  Up close and everywhere, again and again.  I get that this stuff exists in real life, and life is gross, but none of it serves the story or makes any kind of point. It’s there because they think you enjoy it.  Do you enjoy it? I don’t sympathize with these characters and the less I can relate to them the better.
Speaking of the story, even if you fixed all the unnecessary gross stuff, the story just doesn’t exist.  The show doesn’t end.  I guess they’re holding out for another season?  But if they had more space for story, then why did they fly through the Abyss so fast?  Isn’t that place rather important? The main character regularly talked about all the cool things she wanted to see as she went deeper and deeper into the abyss, but none of it was actually explored.  Just “There’s that thing I mentioned, okay either fight it quickly,  or lets move on to the next area”.  This is not the plot you are looking for.
I still do see how the story has potential, but they glaze over all the things that made me want to watch the show.  Mystery world, cool monsters, lost technology, fun characters.  They are there, minus the characters being fun, but the presented show wouldn’t really change if you completely took out those things.  Nothing that I felt was advertised to me got developed.  Instead our main character disregards her interest in exploration and treasure hunting, and sets off with the sole goal of finding her mother at the bottom of the Abyss. Leaving behind all the characters that I thought were going to be important.  Were you preparing to get invested here?  Woops. 
That’s honestly fine, new directions are welcome, but even the mother plot point doesn’t deliver.  It’s just a Shanks and Luffy dynamic, and the writers know that because they don’t bother having a back story like how Shanks made sacrifice to inspire Luffy.  You’ve seen that before, so we just skip to the conclusion trope of “The fact that I’m not here for you is proof that I’m so awesome. Chase me.”  Also, even Luffy had well developed settings ajg characters to support his story.  Yes, I know One Piece is currently infinity longer than Made in Abyss, but 13 episodes is still plenty of time to develop something.
This season is squarely centered around our two main characters, but we learn as much about them as we do other characters that are only in the show for 2 or 3 episodes.  The only consistent way we know that our characters are developing and progressing is by how far they get in the abyss, and they fly through it without expanding on anything that was previously hyped.  Brand new dramatics happen, then the season ends with no hint of a conclusion.  So you get no story.  
The only real story is in the last episode, the “one hour special”, and it has nothing to do with our main characters.  Maybe you could just watch that, but you probably won’t feel good about it.
So why is show with no story, being praised as the best anime of 2017?  Was it (another) bad year for anime?  Why are people whole heartedly recommending a show without mentioning that it goes no where, and children are regularly brutalized and assaulted?  Recommending this show without context is the same as recommending Ebichu the hamster without mentioning that it’s nothing like Hamtaro.  Not that I’d recommend either of those, but I think you know what I’m saying.

Not really a whole lot to say about it.  I just played it.  About half an hour long?  Wasn’t even a walking simulator because it took place all in a car.
It’s alright, if you must play your short stories rather than read them.
Actually it’s a demo for a larger game, so that works.  I hope we’re not stuck in a car for the whole full length game, but I’m definitely interested in the “other gatekeepers” that this demo suggests we’ll come across.  I’ll keep an eye out for more news about this, but I’m not intrigued enough to chase it.

Christmas whiskey.  First time having Knob Creek.  It’s super sharp, especially with ice.  I’ve gone through most of the bottle by now and I’m regretting drinking it with ice so often… Including this time.  I had a taste as soon as I poured it and I thought the whiskey had aged since I last had it.  Now its settled and it tastes like the other times.  For a brief second there it was more bold and full bodied with a slightly peat ending.  Almost Dark Horse like (my absolute favorite). I’ll have to remember that next pour.
It came with a custom glass! Which has fast become a favorite of mine.  Fat bottom glass make my rockin world go round.

      <p>
      
        <h2 id="red-crimes-hidden-murders">Red Crimes: Hidden Murders</h2>
I wanted to try out <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamaga.RedCrimesHM" target="_blank">Red Crimes: Hidden Murders</a> because it was produced by Discovery Channel’s forensic mystery channel thing; Identification Discovery, advertised somewhat real forensics, and it has very pretty artwork.<br /><br />So I did, and unfortunately I have nothing special to report.  It’s a typical freemium game in the most generic way.
<a href="https://66.media.tumblr.com/80371f10f451fcf3059e0f5261889e50/tumblr_inline_pkezw2gKyp1rnrp45_1280.jpg" target="_blank" alt="Red Crimes Hidden Murders Screenshot"><figure data-orig-width="2048" data-orig-height="1536" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/80371f10f451fcf3059e0f5261889e50/tumblr_inline_pkezw2gKyp1rnrp45_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="375" />&lt;/a&gt;
I played until the first criminal was arrested.  That’s as far as I could get after exhausting all my energy and gold points, which took about an hour and a half.  Not the worst demo.  Energy charges at 1 per 3 minutes, and you need 16 to play the next mini game.  However, running out of energy isn’t the only concern.  There are timers all over the place that they want you to pay “gold” to skip.  As usual you can watch a video ad to get gold, but a 30 second ad gets you a whopping 3 pieces.  Can’t do anything with that.
I’m not going to do the math, but I guestimate that this game costs just over $0.50 an hour to play with minimal interruptions.  If the levels get harder it will likely get more expensive.  Is it worth it?<br /><br />Not as it is.  I’m going to assume that I played as much as the developers wanted to give as a demo and it all felt very tutorial-ish.  Even after the main character stopped narrating my every move the mini games remained mindlessly simple.  I wouldn’t be surprised if the developers kept the game design open to be an idle clicker, which unfortunately might have been the more engaging game play choice.<br />
“Gameplay” has you upgrade your police station, so far that just means reskinning the walls; having your police force patrol areas of the town for cash (?!); solving cases via hidden object, drag-to-reveal or collect, and puzzle-piece-match mini games to ultimately reclaim that area of town so you can buy visual upgrades for it.  
I can’t vouch for any accuracy in the forensics because it’s so limited by the simplistic game mechanics.  Some levels even have you hand off an object for another character to work on while you wait (or pay) for the level to complete without doing anything.  Definitely not compelling compared to actual 100% free games of the same genre on the Play store.<br />
There’s an over arching story, which does the job well enough, but the cookie cutter characters don’t seem to have any real stakes in it.  
While the artwork is pretty, you’ve seen all the good stuff already in the advertising.  There’s no variation or animation of the characters in game.
So the game is pretty sub par unless you’re really desperate, or this really hits a specific niche for you.  Overall it really doesn’t feel like the developers want you to play their game.  All the dollar signs around the wait times feel like a warning rather than an invitation.</figure></a>
