I think I’ve finally found the ideal bookmark manager.  As far as I can tell, after using it for half a day.

I started looking for a 3rd party manager when I started using different browsers on different computers.

My biggest desire was to use it like a checklist, like any task oriented web app.  Collect webpages based on projects I was working on.

The first big recommendation was raindrop.io.  It was convenient, but really it just hooked me on mood boards, visual based organization.  Raindrop didn’t let you nest any bookmark collections in its free version.  Really hard to organize with only one level of organization.  So my priorities were now to be able to collect my project resources, and nest them in different categories, AND ideally be graphical about it.

I nearly settled on Ggather.  It had one level of nesting, which seemed like, functionality wise, good enough, but thumbnails weren’t free this time.  Kind of worth settling, but a big clincher was that Ggather was only a couple years old, and I couldn’t find any hint of developer interactivity since early 2019.  Looks like the project could dismantle at any time.  So I searched a little bit more.

Finally I hit Pearltrees.  It’s been around a long time, and it’s blog has been active within recent months.  It’s graphic base, and lets me nest collections of bookmarks.  I’ve found a weird bug where sometimes it saves a bookmark as a pdf rather than a link, which screws it all up, but it has a note feature that allows me to work around that, if they won’t fix it.  So that’s my needs met.

What an exciting day.

Let me know if I missed an obvious choice for bookmark management.

Just read through <a href="https://www.unicornjelly.com" target="_blank">Unicorn Jelly</a> again.  I have the hard copy, as well as To Save Her, but online is still the best way to read.  I wish I was smart enough to be able to have anything worth saying about it.  It opens so slow and simple, and ends so quick and complicated.  I’m amazed at how much went into the world, and how many levels there are to it, and how much I still get out of it on every level that I have in me.<br />

Fermented Tofu, chao, turned out really well.  It's like a crumbly cheddar.  Super salty though.  I'd adjust that next time.  I followed this <a href="https://fullofplants.com/how-to-make-fermented-tofu-cheese-chao/" target="_blank">recipe</a>, but I fermented the Tofu for about a week, until it started to get actually moldy, then I used cooking sherry as the alcohol.  That's probably where the extra salt came in.  I think the sherry flavor was a plus though.  Totally going to make a larger batch next time.

A big reminder to myself not to run disk checks/repairs on a glitchy hdd before attempting absolutely everything to get the files off.  RIP lossless, extended Escaflowne movie ost.<br />
A detailed account in hopes that I don’t forget:<br />I had a large EXT4 HDD disappear off my Rpi nas (lol, so l337).  Restarted a couple times with no change.  Plugged in the drive after a bootup and got an error saying that the mount point was already taken.  Remove the drive from fstab and the error persists, but oddly enough the drive still shows up in the file manager, albeit devoid of content.
Enter command line, where accessing the directory straight up tells me there’s read/write errors.  Dmesg barely elaborates by saying there’s a “medium critical” error, and everything online says to run e2fsck to fix the errors.  Well, attempting a safe run with e2fsck couldn’t complete, so I just had to say “y” to everything and now I have thousands of unnamed files to sort through.<br /><br />What I wish I knew was that I could have plugged the drive into my Windows machine and used ext2fsd to transfer the named files. Then flat out reformatting the corrupted drive would have been a simpler process.  I learned this because after renaming a good chunk of the recovered files, I shut down the system and waited for my replacement drive to arrive in the mail.  Upon boot up, that drive as well as a second one had become corrupted.  Apparently the USB hub which worked great for 4 years decided to start killing off my data, and I had to move over to my Windows machine to have enough ports for transferring.<br /><br />One more caveat though: it seems e2fsck doesn’t handle non-english characters well.  I don’t know what the exact conditions are, because some files made it through, but about 80% of my files with Japanese names, or accented é’s just didn’t show up in the explorer.  <br />
I’m now prepared to do proper back ups, but really, maybe it’s time I just stopped being such a digital horder.  Honestly, I use enough streaming media that I rarely go through my personal files. but still I’m worried that one day after the apocalypse of online entertainment services, I’ll desperately want to play that drm-free copy of Witcher 2.   Here’s hoping there’s still compatibility tutorials to get it working on Windows XX.<br />
