  	<a href="//2012/04/25/I-got-my-first-girlfriend/"><h1>I-got-my-first-girlfriend-</h1></a>
      <p>
      
        <h2 id="together">.together.</h2>
I got my first girlfriend and lost my virginity at the age of 25.  Being in this kind of minority might automatically make my feelings toward sex null and void for the average human but I think I’ve come to a certain clarity of something that I’m vulnerable to.
It only adds to my problems but I was raised conservatively and it repeatedly disturbs me that I am not the first lover that my girlfriend has had.  I’m like her fifth or something and she’s five years younger than me.  I’ve told her this bothers me and she cries and says she feels like a whore which I have to instantly rebuttal;  I know she’s normal, it’s me that’s the strange one here. 
Even though the feeling that we are on uneven ground is there, I’m not wishing that I had more lovers. My analogy is that it’s like we have our own books of love.  My book begins and ends with her.  Her book has four other chapters before my name comes up.  She’s showed me that that example still sounds bad but I don’t mean it like that. 
What really bothers me is these first time and important experiences that I can only relate to having them with her and that’s a big part of what makes them so special.  However, from my view, I can’t understand how these things could possibly feel the same for her.  She’s done them before.  She must have memories to draw from with other people and I’m intimidated by that.  We’re doing things together but my “together” must be different from hers.  Our first time together was my first time but just her first time with me.  This is my realization, that these feelings aren’t about numbers of lovers or stereotypes or whatever; I’m scared of our “togetherness” being threatened.
That’s unfair.  She’s the love of my life.  She feels awful because I feel this way and she says she’d change time if she could.  She promises that it’s always been different with me; we have and we always will do things truly together.  I believe her.  She makes me feel better and safe.  I’m just writing this here because I know the past always bothers me but if I can keep my fears written plainly and her hope with me, I can and will move on.

        <h2 id="my-girlfriend-flies-away-from-me">My Girlfriend Flies Away from Me</h2>
     My girlfriend has gone on vacation with her family for 5 days.  This should be a very normal thing and many people seem to congratulate me on some kind of freedom, but I don’t feel that way.
    I’ve got anxiety issues.  I’ve had them for longer than I’ve known her.  It’s the kind of anxiety that I used to get as a child when I knew that I was going to the doctor to get a needle.  It sticks between my stomach and my heart and often overflows into tears.  While I eventually learned to keep my cool until the shot was done and I didn’t have to worry about being scared of it anymore, these days I don’t know when the anxiety will be finished.  Yes, my girlfriend is coming home.  I talk to her every day and she tells me “I’ll be home soon”.  It’s true, she will be, I will feel better, but the words and the comfort just seems to float through me and I’m still scared. 
     I’m not writing this to complain, I’m not trying to boast about my problems.  I just feel better when I write.  Like maybe I can understand what’s going on if I can break it down just right.
     I don’t know the root of my anxiety.  I blame it on different fundamental problems and I’m trying to narrow down what exactly is the cause.  Overworked?  Too much free time?  Bad social habits?  Loneliness?  I don’t know.  I probably never will or at least the reason will keep changing.
     This week I watched my girlfriend fly away from me and it bothers me.  This is the third time in the last 9 months that she’s done this.  She hasn’t done it willingly and I’m not blaming anyone.  Things just happen and it’s always logical that she leaves without me. 
     What I think bothers me about this is the fact that I’ve only flown 4 times in my life.  It’s not an issue with quantity but three times now she’s flown away from me and it bothers me.  She tells me apologetically that soon we’ll go places together.  I want that but even that isn’t the issue.
     That will be great but right now I think what’s bothering me is how I feel so left behind. Not specifically because of this event but maybe it’s a more difficult and extreme feeling since I have a week to dwell on it alone.  I feel like a kid that was standing in line while my peer captains picked teams and rather than being the last kid picked; I wasn’t acknowledged at all and the game started without me.  I’m right here but things keep happening without me and it feels like I’m the only one left alone.
    Right now I think I’d feel better if I were the one getting on the plane and she was the one who had to miss me.  There’s something wrong with this.  Not just the fact that I’d rather her suffer this way, this time, there’s something logically wrong with it.  I know she misses me right now, she tells me and I know it’s true.  I want to think that if our physical positions were changed, so will our emotional ones.
     Realistically though, if I were on the plane and she stayed behind, she would miss me, exactly how she does now.  She’ll carry on and she’ll miss me.  If I was on a plane; I’d be anxious and scared, trying to write my feelings out because it bothers me.
