I'm like: It's Wednesday.  I'm late for uploading my weekly portraits update.  But actually it's Friday.

I'm very happy to be getting more consistent.  I kind of have a process: get the shape of the face right, eyes halfway, nose halfway, mouth, watch the width! watch the width!  Obviously, I'm still not very accurate with the process.  I'm constantly having problems with width vs height of the head, then either too little forehead or too little chin, but I'm happy to be where I am. 

I've only got 2 more pages left in my sketchbook.  I think I'll do another week, then hopefully try something else.  I want to do daily urban sketchings, but one of the hardest parts of this project was picking out which headshot I wanted to draw.  Finding interesting buildings is going to be much harder for me.

oh well, we'll see
