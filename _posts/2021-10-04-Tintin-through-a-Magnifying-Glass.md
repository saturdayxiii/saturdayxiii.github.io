Tintin 2011 must be one of the most under appreciated movies in history.  I saw it when it came to theatre and I loved it, but now, having had to look up its release date, I'm pretty sure I saw a re-release of it and didn't know of it's existance in 2011.  That sounds insane to me.

None the less, [Breadsword's](https://www.youtube.com/c/BREADSWORD/videos) video might make up for the lack of hype with pure depth.  Bringing together the characters of Tintin with their hollywood portrayers, creator, real world history, alternative in-world history, and the monolithic accomplishment it all was.  

Now, I don't actually believe in spoilers, but at an hour and sixteen minutes, you might as well use that time to watch the actual film first if you haven't already.  As incredible as Georges Remi was, I think that actually seeing the film is probably the most important thing to help continue his legacy... or maybe just buying the books.  I think they're still in print.  I dunno.
