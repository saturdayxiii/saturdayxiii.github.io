Like many, I am very charmed by [Monoli's Pixel Mirror pendant](https://monoli-shop.com/), but I'm never going to be able to afford it. So I had GPT write up a website to generate similar pixel art.  Granted the pixel mirror looks so good because it's not making true pixels; they clearly have a gradient and outlines, but this at least gives me a taste of that charm.  I'm sure it can be simulated more accurately, but I'm content with this.
