<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/280140/Millennium__A_New_Hope/" target="_blank">Millennium a New Hope</a> must have done well as a high school project. Based on the writing and overload of anime/rpg tropes I assume that's what it was made for. I don't know why there are at least 5 of these Millennium games out there, but I think I have a pretty good idea why only one made it to Steam so far, and I'm quite surprised that it did.<br/><br/>This review is technically incomplete, because I haven't finished the game. Everything could change, but I doubt that I'm going to get there. I've been playing for 12 hours and have only obtained 4 out of 5 main characters. That's not a measure of judgment in itself, but I am bored enough to say that I probably won't play much more. Nothing is compelling me to play more.<br/><br/>As an RPG, this game does well in it's mechanics. It's got some interesting methods to power up your characters and lots of variety for weapons and enemies. The game play itself is actually quite commendable. &hellip; Except for the random jumping portions and other unseen elements, but you can't win them all.<br/><br/>Here's the clincher for me. This game is more of a first time fan fiction to JRPGs. All these comments towards the immaturity of the writing of the game is because nothing happens for any reason. Or at least for any understandable reason. What's the conflict\[!\[thumbnail\]\(http://i3.ytimg.com/vi//maxresdefault.jpg\)\]\(https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v=\)><br/>So the story sucks, does this ruin the game\[!\[thumbnail\]\(http://i3.ytimg.com/vi//maxresdefault.jpg\)\]\(https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v=\)><br/>Some people do like this game, and that's fine. Hardcore fans are probably more geared toward gameplay. Newbies probably appreciate the warm and simple storyline. Maybe something changes later that will actually grip me to want to progress, but I don't want to risk another 10 hours on such a low possibility.
