October's got me in the mood for feature lengths.  Fistfuls of feature lengths.  I had watched [Scaredy Cats](https://www.youtube.com/c/ScaredyCatsTV/videos) summary of the new Fear Street trilogy a month ago, and apparently I had already forgotten it, because upon re-watching I see that they had completly spoiled Fear Street 1666.  Maybe that's why spoilers don't affect me, I never pay enough attention for it to matter.  More than that, I thought Scaredy Cats had a more negative opinion of the movies, I knew it was still a recommendation, but I thought they had given some more conflicting opinions, and I was going to give my take here.  Upon rewatching to actually identify these conflicts, I found myself in staunch aggreement for nearly every point.
