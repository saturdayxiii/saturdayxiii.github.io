The old beast is being replaced by the new hotness.

<br/>

An upgrade in every way except for the lack of a graphics card.

I’m hoping to use an external gpu via the wifi card slot.  Which is already a precarious decision, but makes me even more insecure because the ngff adapter I need seems harder to come by.  It’s also a newer format, so maybe it has better odds of success?

The processor seems to have a stable run at 3.1GHz, rarely spiking up to 3.3, but no going back now.  Anyway, these days the games I play are pretty simple graphically.
