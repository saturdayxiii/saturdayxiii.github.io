Spot on.  I didn’t know about the new series coming out, but everything acknowledged here are things I’ve always found treasurable about the original.  Love the two sides of the same coin dynamic of Daria/Jodie, and the humanization of most all characters over the course of the series.  (Special shout out to the Stacey spotlight in the “movie”, though not mentioned here.)
