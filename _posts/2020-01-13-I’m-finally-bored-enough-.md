I’m finally bored enough to update my tumblr.  Here’s some select 
pics from my inktober submissions.  If I get really really bored, I 
should upload all of them to my [deviantart gallery](https://www.deviantart.com/saturdaythe13th).  They are all on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/saturdayxiii/), but I don’t respect that platform.
