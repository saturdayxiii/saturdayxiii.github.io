Simple, cute, amusing point and click. Fun story and characters. I loved playing [Jolly Rover](https://store.steampowered.com/app/58200/Jolly_Rover/).

The game is really tight and everything works well. However, there are some extra things needed for 100% completion that you really have to guess at in order to accomplish. You need to click everything in every scene twice before you move on to a new area of story because you can't go back, and that doesn't guarantee that you'll find everything, because there's no reason for a lot of it. It adds a little replay-ability because it's a short game, but that's a cheap tactic.

This is a pretty easy and short game. If you are a hardcore point &amp; click gamer who wants a challenge and for some reason you paid full price for this game, you'll probably feel pretty ripped off. But for me this game was great fun.
