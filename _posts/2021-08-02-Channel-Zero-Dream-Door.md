I'm glad I never gave up on Channel Zero after that rough [first season](https://saturdayxiii.github.io/2016/10/14/I-watched-the-first-episod/), though I probably should have said something about the other seasons as I watched them.  

I enjoyed them.  

This last one, which admittedly came out a while ago, was probably my favorite, though they've all had their high and low moments.  I loved Pretzel Jack, he's adorable and [Twisty Troy](https://www.instagram.com/twistytroy) is amazing, and I remained amused even when the last episode devolved into synthy, contstruction area b-movie.
A great show.

And I do believe my intuition was kicking in for me to finally finish Channel Zero, as I've learned that Nick Antosca's newest show, [Brand New Cherry Flavor](https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/80233374), is set to premier in a couple weeks.  Looking forward to that.
