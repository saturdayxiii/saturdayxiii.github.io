My weekend was made a whole lot better by discovering [AntsCanada](https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCONd1SNf3_QqjzjCVsURNuA) on YouTube.

I know what you’re thinking.  More “bugs vs bugs” on youtube, or maybe you started a video and rolled your eyes at the typical: Title of the video says this happens, thumbnail shows this happening, youtuber’s intro is “You’ll never guess what happens in this video!!!  Please like and subscribe!”.  I know, I was there.  I didn’t want to watch 25 minutes of prolonged drama, I just wanted to see the titled content and get out; but AC non-family, I promise that AntsCanada is so much more than it appears.

I never intended to watch a full video, but every time I did.  Although the scripted tone of the episodes make the poetically chosen words seem insincere, the drama is real, and Mikey Busto’s house-consuming passion is very evident.

Fantastic animals, with creative stories, beautiful macro cinematography, ingenious vivarium designs, and rarely filmed insect habits make this a must see channel.
