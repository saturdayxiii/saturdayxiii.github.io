  I just found out about iontophoresis and it sounds like something I could benefit from.  I was contemplating buying a $500 machine which Facebook thought I needed, but a quick google brought me to some research about how to DIY it.
  Awesome.
  It looks like I have all the parts I need, but none of the papers went into any kind of description of how to hook things up, and I wasn't 100% certain that I was following the wires correctly from the photos.  They just say "attach the wires", and I'm like: 
  "Wait... just positive on one tub, negative to the other?"
  After much hesitation, and some experimentation: Yes.
  So my set up is currently a 12v 5a DC power supply and some hook up wire going into two plastic tubs with water, and I can feel that it's working.  
  
  I wasn't sure at first because I was using a 2.5v supply.  I could feel an itchy sensation where the water surface met my skin, but not below that.  I think it's due to my softwater, and because I'm using plastic tubs instead of steel.
  
  Anyway, there's some reassurance that DIY Iontophoresis is as stupid simple as it looks.  Now in four weeks I should know whether or not it works for me.
