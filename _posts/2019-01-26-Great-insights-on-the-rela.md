Great insights on the relationships between critics and content producers and mob mentality.  

For the record, I don't mind Uwe's movies, and I like a lot of the ideas he has, but I also typically shut them off half way through.

Double also: while drivel, there's a lot to like about the inaccurate Resident Evil adaptations.  Especially when compared to their animated counter parts.
