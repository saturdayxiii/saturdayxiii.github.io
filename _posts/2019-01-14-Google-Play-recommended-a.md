Google Play recommended <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details\[!\[thumbnail\]\(http://i3.ytimg.com/vi//maxresdefault.jpg\)\]\(https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v=\)>Tiny Bubbles</a>.  It looked nice and boasted a bunch of “awards”, so I figured I’d give it a shot.  I later uninstalled with a resounding “meh”.

It had good mechanics and nice animation, but I played like 20 some levels and they were extremely tutorial-y.  Despite the mechanics constantly evolving the challenge remained nearly non-existent.  Or maybe remembering all the game variations across stages was supposed to be the challenge\[!\[thumbnail\]\(http://i3.ytimg.com/vi//maxresdefault.jpg\)\]\(https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v=\)>
Sorry, but too little, too late; uninstalled.  I’m sure there are people that would enjoy this game a lot, it certainly didn’t seem too bad, but I don’t want to develop a tolerance for this kind of spam.  I didn’t even look at how much they were asking to play unhindered.  Someone else can experiment, I’ve got other things to play.<br/><br/>
