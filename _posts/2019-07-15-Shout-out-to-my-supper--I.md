Shout out to my supper.  I oil fried my remaining tofu puffs and decided to have it in a wrap.  I thought "if only I could make it taste like bahn mi".  I don't know what's particularly special about bahn mi, but mayo, teriyaki, garlic, onion, jalepenos, and carrots seemed to do the trick.  Olives never hurt either.  I'm ready for round 2.
