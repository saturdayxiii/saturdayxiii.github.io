These are actually straight.  My lens is distorting it.  .
After a year and a half the [Snapmaker](http://www.snapmaker.com) finally arrived.  Other than that one time at the [Edmonton Public Library](https://www.epl.ca/browse_program/makerspace/), I’ve never used a 3D printer.

However, printing off a copy of [majda107′s all-in-one te](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2656594)st has me very impressed; despite the noisy 13 hour process.  The print starts getting a little droopy at the 60 degree overhang, but only on the taller column.  The straight, skinny columns really are straight, my macro lens is distorting the image.  Lots of little text was lost, but that may have been me in the software.  I don’t know why it showed up in some places but not others.
