## The irony of North American Conservatives is that the bulk of them are Judeo-Christians.  Christianity is literally a progressive version of Judaism.  Modern progressives are like "how do we eradicate prejudiceness and ensure that everyone recieves basic rights and needs regardless of their status in our society?" And the original Conservatives(in this example) were like "how do we ensure people who work during the Sabbath get punished?" ##
