Hidden object, point and click</a>. If you like those, you will like this. If not, then no, you won't like this.Â

Ehh, it's a fine hidden object, point and click game. If you're expecting something good, you'll likely be disappointed. If you're expecting something horrible, you might be impressed. It's fine.
