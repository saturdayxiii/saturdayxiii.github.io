Hidden object, point and click</a>. If you like those, you will like this. If not, then no, you won't like this. 
But what makes it a good hidden object point and click? I'm not an expert, but I think I can say this was on the enjoyable side of such games. The graphics are pretty but the animation is dated. The story is followable (unlike certain "mystery" games) but simple and forced. The puzzles&hellip; there are puzzles! But their mostly chores and don't stand out as memorable or beneficial to the gameplay. 
Ehh, it's a fine hidden object, point and click game. If you're expecting something good, you'll likely be disappointed. If you're expecting something horrible, you might be impressed. It's fine.
