October's got me in the mood for feature lengths.  Fistfuls of feature lengths.  I had watched [Scaredy Cats](https://www.youtube.com/c/ScaredyCatsTV/videos) summary of the new Fear Street trilogy a month ago, and apparently I had already forgotten it, because upon re-watching I see that they had completly spoiled Fear Street 1666.  Maybe that's why spoilers don't affect me, I never pay enough attention for it to matter.  More than that, I thought Scaredy Cats had a more negative opinion of the movies, maybe it was subliminal from the critical tone.  I knew it was still a recommendation, but I thought they had given some more conflicting opinions, and I was going to give my take here.  Upon rewatching to actually identify these conflicts, I found myself in staunch aggreement for nearly every point.  

So quit wasting time reading my words.  Watch both trilogies.  

I thoroughly enjoyed Fear Street. I loved that the plot misdirection actually worked for me.  It's very fun, if nothing else.  I didn't find the start of the first movie to be off putting, abeit the fact that I do hate asshole characters, but I actually think that I preferred it to the second half when the plot set in hard and everybody just straight played their roles.  Maybe it had something to do with the fact that I put the show on while doing the dishes.  Chores might be the secret ingredient to being a modern film lover.  The relationship of the main couple struck me as a bit toxic in the first movie, but yah, the multi-generational love story won me over that.  It didn't however win me over the use of Calibri and comments about SSDs.  Were those bait?  lol.
