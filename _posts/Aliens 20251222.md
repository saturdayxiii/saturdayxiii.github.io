Avatar obviously wasn't James Cameron's most original work, but I didn't know he had already made a superior version in 86.  And congrats to him for inventing the Cybertruck.

I don't think this movie is as good as the original, and yet I'm hesitant to save the original into my personal collection while I'm sure I can find another occasion to rewatch it's sequel.  They're just very different movies.

The details really struck me.  Both films are gorgeous, but while Cameron nails maximising environmental characteristics, the original was literal coated in intercate designs that oozed untold lore.  Like how the space helmets of the first movie were bordered with strings of runes that I can't fathom the intention of, while I wish I could own a life sized copy of every matte painting from the second one.
