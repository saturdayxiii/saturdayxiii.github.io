No matter how sick I think I am of watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8D687CA0AFC4C655" target="_blank">this Lets Play</a> over and over for the past decade; October rolls around and I just can’t help myself.  <br/><br/>At one point I put the audio logs of the back story in chronological order for easy consumption: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CiwRk7zKQ4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CiwRk7zKQ4</a>
