Yep.  Brand New Cherry Flavor was great.  Fantastic edition to the [Channel Zero](https://saturdayxiii.github.io/2021/08/02/Channel-Zero-Dream-Door/) series.

I've seen criticisms of the ending, which aren't wrong, but also kind of a given because Netflix needs to sequel bait.  However, I personally didn't find it very disatisfying, I can handle dropping a show at a clif hanger though.
