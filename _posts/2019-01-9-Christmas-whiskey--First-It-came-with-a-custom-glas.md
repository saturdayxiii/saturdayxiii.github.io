I had a taste as soon as I poured it and I thought the whiskey had aged since I last had it.  Now its settled and it tastes like the other times.  For a brief second there it was more bold and full bodied with a slightly peat ending.  Almost Dark Horse like (my absolute favorite). I'll have to remember that next pour.</p>
