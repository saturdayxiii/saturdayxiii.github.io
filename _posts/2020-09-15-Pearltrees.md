I think I’ve finally found the ideal bookmark manager.  As far as I can tell, after using it for half a day.

I started looking for a 3rd party manager when I started using different browsers on different computers.

My biggest desire was to use it like a checklist, like any task oriented web app.  Collect webpages based on projects I was working on.  

The first big recommendation was raindrop.io.  It was convenient, but really it just hooked me on mood boards, visual based organization.  Raindrop didn’t let you nest any bookmark collections in its free version.  Really hard to organize with only one level of organization.  So my priorities were now to be able to collect my project resources, and nest them in different categories, AND ideally be graphical about it.

I nearly settled on Ggather.  It had one level of nesting, which seemed like, functionality wise, good enough, but thumbnails weren’t free this time.  Kind of worth settling, but a big clincher was that Ggather was only a couple years old, and I couldn’t find any hint of developer interactivity since early 2019.  Looks like the project could dismantle at any time.  So I searched a little bit more.

Finally I hit Pearltrees.  It’s been around a long time, and it’s blog has been active within recent months.  It’s graphic base, and lets me nest collections of bookmarks.  I’ve found a weird bug where sometimes it saves a bookmark as a pdf rather than a link, which screws it all up, but it has a note feature that allows me to work around that, if they won’t fix it.  So that’s my needs met.  

What an exciting day.

Let me know if I missed an obvious choice for bookmark management.
