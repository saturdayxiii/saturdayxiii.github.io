By lodhart, then brimstone326.  So, not my design, but it is probably the most complicated thing I've printed so far... complicated as in lots of small bits.  I'm very happy that the process came together as smoothly as it did.  Even happier that Snapmaker finally fixed their pause print feature so it doesn't spit out the filament when I try to change colors.  So liberating when I can make gradients and add transparencies.
