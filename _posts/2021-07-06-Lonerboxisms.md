Finally doing some mild binging of [Lonerbox's videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi5pr6jdzVMWNObsiiAYpEA).  His latest exploration of the benefits received by extremists when allowed freedom to platform, even when their ideas are bad, has been refreshing and I'm currently enjoying the rabbit hole through [conservatives's longstanding dependancey on willing untruthfulness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NEQoNUat0k), and how [geography and environment downsized most African's needs to adopt and advance technologies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx1Jg4QAPmM).
