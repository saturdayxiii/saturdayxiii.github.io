I am fully on board with AI.  I love using the Dream Textures Blender addon for making seamless textures.  I don't find them particularily useful, but I'm enamoured by them.  I also got Chat-GPT to code a gallery webpage for repeating textures.  I've been doing all kinds of little programming things in Chat-GPT.  Yes, I still think I can claim some responsibility.  GPT reguarly makes mistakes so it's a team effort to make things function.

I would have loved it if my favorite image viewer [Nomacs](https://github.com/nomacs/nomacs/releases), or any image viewer really, had an automatic tiling feature so I could easily view patterns, but this web version is pretty sweet.  If you want it for yourself just copy the html straight up.  I want the images to retain their names, but you could make a easy image swap version by changing every .webp file and code line to a simple number: 01.jpg, 02.jpg, etc whatever.  Then just replace the image files with ones of the same names.  Err, yah... it's useful!
