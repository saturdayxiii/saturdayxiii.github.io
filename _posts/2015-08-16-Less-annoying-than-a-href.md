Less annoying than <a href="http://saturdayxiii.tumblr.com/post/182014542454/millennium-a-new-hope-must-have-done-well-as-a" target="_blank">Millenium</a>.<br/><br/>When I recommend a game, I typically recommend it based on how well it meets it's advertised hype. After all, that's usually what convinces you to buy a game. If the game doesn't live up to that hype, then you were cheated out of your money.<br/><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/286220/Pier_Solar_and_the_Great_Architects/" target="_blank">Pier Solar</a>, while not a terrible game, doesn't live up to that hype.<br/><br/>The biggest hype of Pier Solar is that it is a port of a Genesis/Megadrive game. Forget it, that has no factor here. The graphics have all been updated so it looks like any other decent RPG Maker game. The story never was up to snuff of genesis RPGs. The FM based sound is the only thing that's left, but it's not on by default, so I guess even the developers didn't think that you would prefer the 16-bit version.<br/><br/>So the graphics are decent. I don't need to explain that because there are screenshots, what you see is what you get. But what's wrong with the story\[!\[thumbnail\]\(http://i3.ytimg.com/vi//maxresdefault.jpg\)\]\(https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v=\)><br/>Everything else is pretty typical. The battle system has a neat "gather" feature which acts as a multiplier while fighting. Required for certain spells. That's the only thing that seems worth mentioning. Battles are actually rather simplistic because you can't seem to share elemental powers between characters. Eg: fire based weapons are only available for the fire based character. The overworld also has the typical "get stuck on corners/can't tell what is or isn't a wall" features that you expect from RPG Maker games.<br/><br/>You can't expect Phantasy Star out of every retro tribute game, and WaterMelon made a lot of effort for a comparable 16-bit game. Without the 16-bit hardware, however, Pier Solar is just another of the many fan made RPGs on Steam.<br/>
