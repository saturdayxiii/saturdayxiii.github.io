Here’s a week of progress.  Drawing at least one quick portrait every day.  I’ve gotten more used to my tool of choice.  Now if only I could be a better artist.
I am feeling a little more controlled.  Feeling more successful in small areas.  I’ll keep it up and see what happens.
I really think I’m on to something with these small 20 minute projects.  At least if I can actually get a sense of some consistency across them.  Normally my art projects take 4-6 hours easily, but I think there’s too many elements in one piece for me to absorb much growth.  Then I also do them a lot less often because they take so much effort.  We’ll see if I can stick to this, and maybe I can even apply it to other creative areas I want to do more of.<br/>
