This is fun, but considering the effort, I didn't really save that much money from just buying a "cheap" vertical garden on Amazon.  Could of saved that energy to learn how to actually take care of plants.  Oh, and next time I'd double the "Y" pipes rather than havind long spacers between them.

Big thank you to the young part timers at home depot who handsawed the column pipe for me.  I totally thought you would have had power tools.
