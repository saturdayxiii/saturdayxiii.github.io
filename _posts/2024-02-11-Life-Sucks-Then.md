This week's 8 page ashcan comic was done all digitally and it took... 17 hours.    I blame my lack of scale.  So, so many lack of scales.  A lot of my details, you can even notice digitally in the first couple of panels, were just lost once I printed it out.

I used [Concepts](https://concepts.app/) to draw it.  I had a lot of complaints while I was getting familiar with it, it still really sucks with precision as you can't even align items and I have no idea how to adjust the PPI in it, but even still I think I'll keep using it.  It's vector hybrid editing really helped when on the last 2 pages I realize I had scaled my comic pages wrong and had to edit my layouts to be taller.
