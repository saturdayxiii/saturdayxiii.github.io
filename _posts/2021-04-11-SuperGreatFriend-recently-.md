SuperGreatFriend recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-EyBetqar0" target="_blank">attempted</a> to play Michigan: Report from Hell.  Despite all the deserved flack this game gets, it's still amazing how it is never not entertaining.  No matter who plays it, or how apathetically.  The game is a comedy force.
I'm sharing iconoclast187's playthrough because I favor his knowledgeable explanations of what's actually going on.
This movie version is also good.

Neither is complete though.  100% playthroughs are not possible, and it's a shame to miss any of it.
