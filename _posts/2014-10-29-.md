From a person who hasn't played this type of strategy game in a long time, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/311980/Isomer/" target="_blank">Isomer</a> is a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Gameplay\[!\[thumbnail\]\(http://i3.ytimg.com/vi//maxresdefault.jpg\)\]\(https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v=\)><br/>Now the game has tutorials: personally I liked it better without them. I liked being able just to play the game. You got attacked in your base in the first 2 minutes of game play\[!\[thumbnail\]\(http://i3.ytimg.com/vi//maxresdefault.jpg\)\]\(https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v=\)><br/>Isomer has a simple style; rather cartoony. I like that. Night time is even kind of creepy the first couple times. First play through of Minecraft kind of creepy, but less impending doom. There's even hints of a developing story taking place. I sure hope that gets implemented more in the future!<br/><br/>I haven't played this type of game in a long time, and cartoony-ness doesn't ruin my immersion. These are pros for me. Beyond that you still have a stable game that will bring quite a bit of fun if you are into casual strategy.
