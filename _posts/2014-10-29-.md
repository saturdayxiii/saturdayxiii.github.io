From a person who hasn't played this type of strategy game in a long time, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/311980/Isomer/" target="_blank">Isomer</a> is a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Gameplay?Â  Well, it functions. Things aren't polished, there's a lot of features that we hope to see included, and the control limitations take a little getting used to, but it functions, and it's fun. You play the aliens, invading from another planet, you fight humans, who are also invading from another planet, I guess. Gather resources, build your base, trade up your inventory, explore, and conquer. Some simple formulas done properly to give you great gameplay value.<br/><br/>Now the game has tutorials: personally I liked it better without them. I liked being able just to play the game. You got attacked in your base in the first 2 minutes of game play? That's the tutorial. Worked great for me. I had some questions about which actions should be prioritized, but learning that is the bulk of the enjoyability in this type of strategy game, and it's not hard to figure out by experimentation. So it's a great game if you actually like to learn while you play, rather than mindlessly carrying out instructions and quests. <br/><br/>Isomer has a simple style; rather cartoony. I like that. Night time is even kind of creepy the first couple times. First play through of Minecraft kind of creepy, but less impending doom. There's even hints of a developing story taking place. I sure hope that gets implemented more in the future!<br/><br/>I haven't played this type of game in a long time, and cartoony-ness doesn't ruin my immersion. These are pros for me. Beyond that you still have a stable game that will bring quite a bit of fun if you are into casual strategy.
