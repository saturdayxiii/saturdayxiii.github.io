Secret Raspberry Pi cupboard with 10Tb of cloud storage.



I’m super happy to find an <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Raspberry-pi-3-2-3-5-5-7-10-1-inch-touch-HDMI-LCD-display-module/32864661234.html" target="_blank">affordable 5&quot; screen</a>.  And it works perfectly with the official Raspbian OS.  Makes me want to buy another.  Maybe for my desktop computer.  A small screen for reading notices and small stuff that I don’t want on my main screen.  Oh wait, that’s what I use my phone for.
