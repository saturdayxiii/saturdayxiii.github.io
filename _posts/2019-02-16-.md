The A E S T H I T I C of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/493710/Laraan/" target="_blank">Laraan</a> makes if very difficult to tell how far away things are, which is a bad thing for platforming. There's also very floaty hit detection, like hit boxes are a ways outside of the physical objects; and the camera, which controls like it's buoyantly moving through jelly, frequently jumps up close to the character which doesn’t let you see what's in front of you.

Story wise it’s Noah’s ark&hellip; except God’s like “I killed everyone, now bring me shiny things or die trying.”  There’s visual elements of a backstory, but what am I supposed to feel?  My only goal is to get shiny things.  Am I trying to please this menacing god?

  Do I care for revenge?

  Maybe my real motivation is just to find more sweet hover bikes that explode when rocks look at them funny.  Not a lot going on here for a game that performs so frustratingly.
