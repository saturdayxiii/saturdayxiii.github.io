Spent Valentines with my Sweetie, drinking coke and wine, while watching [Bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_(1996_film)), presented by [Homo-cidal](https://www.facebook.com/HOMO-CIDAL-215031542009836/) at the [Metro](http://www.metrocinema.org).  All of my favorite things meshing together, it was more like my birthday or something.  What, Valentines is not supposed to be all about me?  

I wish I had the ability to take my simplistic thoughts and make them engaging like the movie did.
