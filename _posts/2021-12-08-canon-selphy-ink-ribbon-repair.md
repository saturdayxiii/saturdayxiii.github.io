I love mini printers.  Unfortunately, they are less useful and upfront more expensive than larger printers.  Luckily, they are also relatively easy to repair.

My fresh out of the bag ink ribbon shredded upon install in my selphy-1200.  It's my last ink ribbon, so I had might as well open it up.  

The ripped pieces rolled out from inside the printer easy enough, and the ink casing popped open with just a couple of pen pushes.  Low and behold, the ribbon itself is held in place by a single piece of scotch tape.  I didn't even bother with new tape as it pulled off the plastic cleanly.  A clean cut across the ribbon, line it up as straight as I can, and with a couple of twists we're back in business.

It now makes strange grinding noises only when it does the clear coat pass of the images, but it's printing fine.
