This is the vibe I'm craving this October.  It's ridiculous how versatile Jim Hension effects were.  

This was actually my first time watching the movie.  I have vague memories of seeing bits of it as a very young child.  Young enough that I'm not sure if I haven't actually not seen the movie, or just repressed most of the nightmare fuel bits.  So much screaming and fish eye.  Either way, the scenes I remembered have stuck with me for over a quarter century and today I was in the perfect mood to witness the full thing.

Half way through I decided to check in to trak.tv and I learned that there's a 2020 of this movie.  Often I'm interested in the modern camp flare of remakes, but the screen shots I saw just made me sad.  So much of what makes this movie is its textures and visual distortions.  It doesn't look like they even tried to capture that in the new version.
