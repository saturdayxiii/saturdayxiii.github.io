[Jacob Gellar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeTfBygNb1TahcNpZyELO8g) Touches and expands on a couple of my current core beliefs.  The fact that we do live forever as a community consciousness, and how our desire to postpone individual death is one of the most narcistic disservices that we can do to ourselves and our world.

... Jacob doesn't really come close to talking about that, but that is what I wanted him say in this exploration of individual identity through immortality.
