 - at least a month of constant visual reference
 - after 2 months you'll probably have most keys memorized, but you'll be confused by your silly mistakes
 - around 3 months you'll probably be comfortable typing, but be frusteratingly slow
 - then multiple key patterns will start clicking into habit.  ing's, the's, ers's, etc
 - it should feel like a natural muscle memory by 6 months?


 - note big milestones, it never actually feels like you're making progress
 - don't feel bad about using a regular keyboard when you're frusterated.  One hand can't compare to two.  Don't give up' just come back when you have energy to try again
 - be consistent with your body/hand positioning when learning.  Sit up straight at a desk if you can and anchor your fingers in a "usual" place.  It will miminize "stupid" mistakes. -
