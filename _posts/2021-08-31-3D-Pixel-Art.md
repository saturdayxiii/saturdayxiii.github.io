[Dino Hazard](https://bonecollectors.itch.io/dino-hazard) was my inspiration for revisiting Blender pixel art.  I love that SNES Jurassic Park asthetic, but that swf Game Maker pixel art has always triggered me.  I don't think this matches the style as much as I was hoping, but it was a fun project.
