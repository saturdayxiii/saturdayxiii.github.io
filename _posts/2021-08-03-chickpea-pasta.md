Once again an ad on Facebook outed itself with a good idea that I could do much cheaper by myself.

Chickpea Pasta

Made up the same as regular pasta: 3/4 cup of chickpea flower, an egg, and a dab of oil and salt.  

It needs to be made much thinner than what I did though, as it really takes its time to cook through.  On the plus side it's also very difficult to overcook, which is my main peeve with regular pasta.  It does have a noticeable chickpea taste, which is also a perk in my opinion.

Might be time to invest in a cheap pasta roller.
