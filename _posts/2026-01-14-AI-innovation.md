I’ve really been enjoying AI, particularly what it’s doing to people.

I totally agree with the need for regulation, but beyond our society’s usual impulse toward wealth disparity and climate catastrophe, it is:  
A: cool to do digital things on command  
B: amazing having actualized talking computers from so many of my childhood cartoons (ie, [Nicole from _Sonic SatAM_](https://info.sonicretro.org/images/thumb/0/07/Nicole.jpg/300px-Nicole.jpg))  
And above all, C: **it’s** made us actually seek and value raw humanity.

Being machine-like—calculated and precise—has always been a cherished quality in humans, especially by employers. But now, if people want robot-like work, they can get an actual robot to do it. With so many people deciding AI is not for them, there’s a whole new demand for human imperfection.

Humans want human connection, and as we’ve rapidly seen AI develop, we’ve learned some shortcuts for recognizing humanity. A big one is imperfection. Wobbly lines, spelling mistakes, poor timing. When we’re looking to avoid AI, we’re learning to look at human creation as if the creator’s mother were looking at it. Intention is value, and mistakes are either signatures of personality or temporary.

This might sound like we’re embracing poor workmanship, but I think humans are naturally too competitive to be concerned about that. We still love to categorize and rank things. We’re just finding the point of entry much more appealing now.

Starting with the COVID reset, our communities have been building more programs to get people out of their homes, and now this trend against AI has given people an ideological cause to respond to. Or at least, that’s how I’m seeing it.

Then again, I am at the center of my own world; we all are. We choose the people we jive with, build environments that suit us, and are attracted to—and attractive to—things that fit us. So to me, it feels like the whole world is realizing this, but maybe I’m just getting older?

I might be at an age where I naturally get more tolerant and open toward people… if that’s a thing? I’ve learned that high standards take a lot of effort and ultimately limit enjoyment, and I think that’s a maturity thing. I mean, I did it superficially as a child, where I chased good feelings at the expense of every other boundary keeping me sane and safe. But after 180-ing from that, I think it’s natural to come full circle again with a more balanced perspective. Still, **it’s** got to be a societal trend to some extent, right?

In the early 2010s, critiques were the highest fashion. From food to video games, the driving force of the internet was people telling each other what was wrong with the way they did things, and what the right way was to go about it. So it wasn’t just me, but I don’t know how far outward it extends. A global movement? Or just my media echo chamber?

I like that people are enjoying things more. It makes me optimistic that I’m going to be enjoyed more, and that I’ll do more enjoying.

I feel like I don’t really get to enjoy things until that trend or season is wearing out. Or maybe that’s where I’m bridging the societal trend with the age thing.

Age 12, 22, 37. I’ve noticed that I start accepting my body in the mirror right before it high-speeds through the next aging sequence and I’m given new colors, spots, rolls, and wrinkles to come to terms with. Likewise, in the ’90s I struggled to be anything; in the 2000s, I struggled to be cool; in the 2010s, I struggled to be skilled; and now I’m optimistic that my mind’s in the right place to catch the latest change a bit early. Hopefully enjoying it for longer.

So clearly, whatever is happening is as temporary as anything. I wonder what should be prepared for next in order to continue the enjoyment?
