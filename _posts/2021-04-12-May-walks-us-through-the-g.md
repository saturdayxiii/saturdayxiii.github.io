May walks us through the grim themes of Tideland so we don't have to.
This movie is sitting unwatched within my hoard, and this video was a rollercoaster.  I was set on deleting my copy through most of it, but the longer it went on, the more intricate and personal things got.  Tideland has lots to say about personal, social, and natural situations, and May captured and reflected all the best parts perfectly.  I thought about this movie, myself, my relationships, and the greater world that contains us all.  I'd call that a perfect review.
