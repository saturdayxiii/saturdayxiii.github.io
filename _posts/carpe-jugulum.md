I see a lot of posts about in what order to read Terry Pratchet's Discworld series.  It's mostly because I just finished it, but I'm throwing in that Carpe Jugulum is a great place to start.  And also I don't read them; Nigel Planar's narration is simply iconic. It deserves to be a disc universe of its own.
I've listened to 8 or 10 Discworld books so far, and I don't remember which one was THE one where I started seeing the value of the series.  My first experience was the Going Postal TV special, but I didn't know if its extended universe at th etime.  I knew Discworld was popular, so I put one on to fall asleep to.  I don't remember which one it was.  I've always just picked them randomly.  The Death story line was the easiest to connect with and I think it's a great place to branch from since Death interacts with all the story lines, but if you don't mind starting farther along in the timeline, I think Carpe Jugulum is an easy choice to exemplarize the Discworld series.  It might just be my growing familiarity with the world and characters, but it's faster pace than the few earlier titles I've listend to, and it feels so developed.  This really, really is more likely a reflection of my growing experience, but all the set pieces feel like they are hardcoded and in motion in this story.  As opposed to other stories were characters are still exploring and developing.  Obviously exploring and developing isn't a bad thing, and this one does have lots of character growth, but if you're choosing a Discworld introduction Carpe Jugulum strikes me as more sure-footed and will eagerly pull you along for the ride.
So it has a good atmosphere, but I think thematically it's really emblematic of the Discworld series... that I've been exposed to so far.  Intersectionality.  What changes, what never will, and how to navigate when you don't know which is which.  Instinct within will.  Nature within religion.  Roles within identity. Vampires within witches.  Pixies within a king. A lot goes on in what is surmisedly a rather simple story about a clan of vampires overcoming their legendary weaknesses and politely invading Lancre castle.
