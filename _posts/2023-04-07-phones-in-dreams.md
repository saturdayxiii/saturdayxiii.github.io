Finally had my mobile phone appear in a dream and I hope it never happens again.  I caught a call just as it was going to voicemail, and the message was hilarious so I gathered my friends to listen to it, but everytime I hit play the message was something different, and everyone was annoyed at me.

I also have a theory why phones don't appear in dreams (often): too multi functional.  In my dream the smartphone was only a smartphone when I answered the call, then it became a traditional phone when I was trying to navigate the answering machine, then it became a stereo when I was trying to share the message.  I guess a palm sized screen is too complicated for my brain to keep track of what's going on and stay asleep.

I didn't question the changing devices until I woke up and remembered dreaming that I looked at an incoming call screen screen, pressed tactile buttons, then spun a volume knob.
