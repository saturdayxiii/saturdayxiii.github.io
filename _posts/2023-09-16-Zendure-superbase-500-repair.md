I got the [Zendure SuperBase 500](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zendure/superbase-500-power-station-compact-and-always-ready-to-go/description) off Kickstarter a couple years ago. I used it regularly with my 12v stereo and would recharge with the provider Solar panels.  Within 6 months the Superbase had lost 40% capacity.  It could power my stereo for a week or two per charge, so it was well below its promised 500 cycles.  

FYI, I used a [Jackery Explorer 160](https://www.jackery.com/products/explorer-160-portable-power-station) before and after the Superbase for the same job, same panel recharges, and it's still trekking with no problems.

A few months later the Superbase is unusable, barely even pulling 10%.  The indicator would show recharge to 100%, but it would just shut off around 90% and I'd plug it into the charger and it would start recharging from 0%.

I contacted Zendure, but the official response was that the batteries were not reasonably recoverable.  This response was expected, but the situation bugged me.  I was getting slightly different behaviors depending if I charged from USB C, or USB A.  I also noticed that in any case, when the Superbase charged to 100% and shut off I could replug it back into the charger and sometimes it would shut off right away, other times it would charge for a few minutes more.

No matter how many times I tried to top it off there wasn't a noticeable difference in battery life, but I wasn't satisfied yet...

TLDR / should of lead with the conclusion:  I plugged the Superbase into one of those power timers that lets you turn off the power every 30 minutes.  I left it plugged in for 2 weeks and I've regained at least 80% of its capacity.  This has been consistent for a couple recharges now.

I'm sure it does better on a single charge now, but I haven't addressed the original defect where it will quickly lose capacity with regular charging. So I leave it on the timed charger for as long as possible.  I use the solar panels for my Jackery products.

If you have a faulty power product, maybe trickle charging could be your savior too!
