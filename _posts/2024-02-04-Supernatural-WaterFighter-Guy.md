Trying to do 8 page ashcan comics as fast as I can.  This one was hand drawn and was an interesting re-learning of my whole comic making process.  The product was a mess and my work pages were pretty much destroyed.  I'm happy to reassert my allegiances to digital art.  I had it my head that I could hammer one out in maybe 4 hours...this took 12 hours over the week.
