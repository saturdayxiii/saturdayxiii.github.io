I was in the mood for some Stephen King vibes, but in the realm of, like, Misery, then The Mist was right there on Netflix's main page so I tried that.  Yah, no.  Not what I was after, but I did get into it and binged it anyway.

Really unfortunate introduction to the story, but the characters have some great archs.  You have your different layers of good and rotten characters, then by the end everyone ercept one person is a complete asshole.  Normally I hate asshole media, but there was some quality misdirection happening.  I don't really care if they continue the clifhanger ending into another season, I had a good time with this as it was.
