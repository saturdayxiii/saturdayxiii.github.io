                                    <h2>Laputa and self reflection regarding anime [journal]</h2>
                    <figure data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="770" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/e480cc0e91d334f6c8f6c49a7f6ada76/tumblr_inline_of7ju2dfl21rnrp45_540.jpg" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="770"/></figure><p>Yesterday I saw Castle in the Sky at my local Theatre.<br/></p><p>I’ve gone to the theatre to see a couple Studio Ghibli films, as well as a select few other anime movies, and each time it poises a small conundrum for me; I can’t stand anime, but I enjoy seeing these films.</p><p>I’ve felt this way for about half a decade now, but for the rest of my life I’ve adored anime.  I was raised on Wizard of Oz, Bumpety-Boo, Mrs. Spoon, and regularly demanded that <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPbSIsDRiuTw&amp;t=ZWE0M2M3YjUyY2NmNjRmYmRiMDAwOTNjOTA1YjcwYzkzNGIwODEwZSxFQTAzVlRCcw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A4Dx-RtxNVkeJxeOPkCZIPA&amp;m=1" target="_blank">Serendipity the Pink Dragon</a> be rented for me.  Once I was old enough to recognize “anime” as a branding term I wholeheartedly subscribed to the otaku way.  Now, however, I can’t make it 3 episodes into any new anime without getting angry.  Nor can I dedicate time to my previous favorites without getting bored. So when I opt to pay money to watch a film in theatre and find myself being entertained it’s confusing.</p><p>Studio Ghibli is not exempt from the things I think I hate about anime.  Their films are rife with recycled voice actors, swap-able soundtracks, repeating character designs, and reoccurring personalities.  While I am safe from nose-picking heroes riddled with inner turmoil, and obligatory panty jokes, the stories of Ghibli movies are some of the least dynamic I’ve ever seen (you’d think that they made these movies for children, or something), and don’t let that message of environmentalism hit you too hard on the way through.  Yet when they come to my local big screen, I look forward to participating in the experience.</p><p>And it certainly is not the theatre experience that changes this for me.  I enjoy Ghibli at home as well, but because I can’t identify what keeps it enjoyable while still appealing as an anime I don’t actively seek out the few films I have yet to see.  Over saturation could be part of my problem.  Yet, despite how rare it is for me to do so, I often feel punished for experimenting on my own.  Even when attempting to re-experience old favorites.  Your dilemmas feel forced and self imposed now, Vash.  Castle in the Sky in the Ghibli spectrum should conjure up the same irritations that the last hit show I watched in the general anime spectrum did, but it doesn’t.  I’ll be back for more, and I’m not sure why.</p><p>So, I went and saw Laputa: Castle in the Sky yesterday.  The artwork was wonderful, and the score was lovely.  The story wasn’t very interesting, and the characters didn’t develop, but it was exciting to see them chased into the awe-inspiring caverns of the earth, adventurously fly with pirates through the clouds, and I held my breath as they scaled the outer walls of the flying castle Lupita.  I would see it again, but preferably while I had something else to do, like chores, or an art project.  6 out of 10.</p>
