                    <h2>The irony of North American Conservatives is that the bulk of them are Judeo-Christians.  Christianity is literally a progressive version of Judaism.  Modern progressives are like &ldquo;how do we eradicate prejudiceness and ensure that everyone recieves basic rights and needs regardless of their status in our society?&rdquo; And the original Conservatives(in this example) were like &ldquo;how do we ensure people who work during the Sabbath get punished?&rdquo;</h2>
