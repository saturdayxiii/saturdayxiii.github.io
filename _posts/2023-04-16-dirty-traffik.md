I made a website for a local DJ, Dirty Traffik [dirtytraffik.live](http://dirtytraffik.live). I wanted a catchy, electro- profile pic.  So after searching through half a dozen filter based websites, I just drew the pic on the right.  Then I didn't like it with the website, so ended up just vector stamping a photo of the DJ and manually adding artifacts.  Now that it's all done, I like the pic I drew again.  So here's both.  They each have their merits, I think, though I imagine its difficult to dislike just one of them
