Like everyone on YouTube, [Georg Rock-Smi's latest videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/GeorgRockallSchmidt/featured) have been going full political rather than mere jabs at the state of our world wrapped in topics of hollywood and pop culture, and I appreaciate it. 
This video excellently highlights the relationship between human suffering and not being able to keep up with the Jones'.  Food for thought which has left me hungry for more.
