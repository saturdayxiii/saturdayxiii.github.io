I watched most of the waking hours of AGDQ this year.  I have a growing disinterest that I assume is coming from over-familiarity.  But my favorite part, which challenged that notion, was the [legend of Zelda: Link to the Past](https://youtu.be/Gcbhkqub6ZI) segment.  It was a positive experience with a lot of close calls.  I also enjoyed the [super Metroid](https://youtu.be/rbyV3MCR9xk) finale.  Maybe it just took me all week to get into it?
