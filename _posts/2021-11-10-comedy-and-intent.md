This topic is way over done, and this video is way too long.  But despite that, I've never felt so educated by such low brow comedy.  This video made me feel more enlightened about comedy, and the conservative mindset, and after only a couple repititions I couldn't help but laugh at the embarrarssingly juvinile example jokes.

I don't have faith many people will give this feature length rant the time of day, so luckily they have some nicely laid out chapters were you might be able to picke out something that interests you.  I was personally piqued by the examination of the Babylon Bee, which actually starts at the *conservatives would rather* chapter, then concludes in its dedicated one.
