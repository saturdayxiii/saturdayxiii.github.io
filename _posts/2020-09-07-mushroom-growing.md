Many moons ago I picked up a Pink Oyster mushroom farm.  I broke it up and placed a few spoon fulls into a boiled jar of cedar shavings, and that looked to have grown decently.  So I moved that into this 10 liter dollarstore container with a usb fan, and a ultra-sonic mister.  One month, and one fruit fly infestation later, all I can say is that it was successful.  But unfortunately I didn't get anything useable out if it.  I'd love to try again, but with a proper set up.  Like, a tub with a lid that fits properly... and a raspberry pi to monitor and adjust absolutely everything.
