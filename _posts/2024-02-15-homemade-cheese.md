I didn't think this was going to work out as the flavor was pretty chalky when it was freshly made, but after a day in the fridge this bundle of curds from slightly off milk is actually tolerable.  Nice and firm, easy to snack.  I should have added salt when it was first curdled, but the seasoning salt on the outside is fine.
