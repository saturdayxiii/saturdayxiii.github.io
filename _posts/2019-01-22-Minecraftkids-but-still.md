Minecraft=kids, but still=good fun
This was the first show that demonstrated my lack of interest in co starred Let's Plays, but that happened many many episodes in.  Talk to me not your friends. 
Seri’s enthusiasm about digital wildlife, and detail put into her crafted worlds makes Zoo Crafting a very fun and uplifting waste of time.
