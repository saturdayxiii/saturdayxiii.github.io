Yesterday I caught a Sonic Advance race on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick" target="_blank">GamesDoneQuick</a>.  It reminded me how under appreciated Sonic Advance 2 is, despite seemingly everyone in the chat reassuring each other on how amazing it is.

Maybe "under appreciated" is the wrong term, perhaps its too accepted.  Not controversial enough.  Sonic is a huge brand, so even though the Advance games are an offshoot, there is still a huge amount of people who have played them, and I'm under the impression that the majority have enjoyed it.  But when people speculate, albeit less so since Sonic Mania, how Sonic games haven't really improved since the Genesis days, Sonic Advance is still regularly overlooked.

I'd love to see the Advance games picked apart, or over glamorized, as much as the other Sonic titles.  Actually that goes for most of the Sonic portable titles, or at least including the Rush series.  There's just so much there that was brought to the franchise that just seems like it's fenced off in its own fractioned fandom.

Anyway, here's an old vid by the Geek Critique which I don't agree with, but he makes a lot of great points that I think apply better to gaming in general.  I'd argue that being a good Sonic game is a bit different than being a good general game, but hairs would need to be split.
