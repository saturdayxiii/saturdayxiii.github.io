I wanted to make some pixel art and having been introduced to Blender pixel art before, and loving how such a catch-all program Blender is, I decided that that's what I wanted to do, but now I have to re-learn how to do that.  Well, it didn't take long to find this video from [Soyaa](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk0taWcQZnzVYN1qcSnwlpg) that is a fine tutorial, but more importantly has references in its description to learn every step in the process.  Wow.  I wish this wasn't the last day of my weekend to go through this stuff.

edit: As good as the tutorials are, [Mezaka's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEbQnZQQtzATJreYx78uw6A) plugin is [awesome](https://saturdayxiii.github.io/2021/08/31/3D-Pixel-Art/).  Especially if you add the extra features he goes over in his video:
