I’m learning to tumblr properly.  Here’s [another new blog](https://tinythings.tumblr.com/) where I’ll be moving all  my insect and macro photos.  If you’ve followed me for those photos, please follow me over there.

There’s clearly a mild following for my spider pictures and the like, and I feel bad every time I post some personal bs and it’s obvious that most of my followers aren’t here for that… True that I’ll probably never have followers interested in my BS, but still.  The mass amounts of insect pictures are being relocated and I’ll continue to post random art bits and blog posts here.  I’m sure the occasional bug will turn up here too.  Especially any new pictures of the snake.  Now if only I’d generate content worthy of my “professional” blog at [https://heavyhanded.ca](https://heavyhanded.ca), that really would be an improvement.
