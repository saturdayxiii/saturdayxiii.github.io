The charging circuit blew on my [W-King 220w Bluetooth Speaker](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B09ZQTX3WJ) and I couldn't find any dismantling guides.  After some false starts, apparently the grill is only glued in a couple spots and pops off relatively easily.  Then the screws through the drivers are accessible which will give you access to the main board with amplifier/charge circuits, and the battery pack behind the other driver.  I didn't repair the charge circuit, but I pulled the battery out so it can be charged externally.  If I'm feeling lucky I'll try to power the speaker with a 12 volt battery pack.  That's not tooo far off from the 10.8v pack installed.
