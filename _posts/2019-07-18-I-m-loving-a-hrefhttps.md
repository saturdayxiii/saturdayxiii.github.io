I’m loving <a href="https://www.kongregate.com/games/terra0nova/aground" target="_blank">Aground</a>.  I was looking for something casual to pick up and go.  Some video game chores to keep me busy.  Aground was recommended through Kongregate and I lucked out because it kept me busy and was fun too.  I haven’t done much else but play this game for the last 4 days.
It looks like a typical indie survival, crafting game, but the story goes farther than I was ever expecting.  I don’t really know what I can recommend to others about it, it just hits a lot of the points that I’ve been looking for in a game these days.  Pick up and play, exploration based, difficulty depends on how aggressive you play (very low for me), expanding story.
I wasn’t expecting this to be anything more than an afternoon dip, but I’m still here swimming in it.  Now I’m about done digging up the massive crashed space ship, so I’ve gotta go finish raising and flying my dragons.
