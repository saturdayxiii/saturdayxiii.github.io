I've been thinking about 3d modeling a lot lately.  I decided to try and do Sickly Wizard's awesome environment tutorial for ps1 graphics ( <a href="https://youtu.be/NcmO6Sxmq14" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/NcmO6Sxmq14</a> ).  Seems very approachable.  Of course the 15 minute tutorial took me 10 hours to do.  Further exasperated by the fact that it took days for me to think of a scene I even wanted to model.  I didn't even technically finish the tutorial because I didn't do any of the vertex lighting stuff.  I really wanted to be done, and this is a start I guess.  I'll do something different next time&hellip; With a lot less polygons.  I need to choose better textures, it's so easy to want to focus on a feature in the texture, but those identifiable features are what kill the repeatability.  I also can't seem to stop over working my models.  Way too much rounding on the boulders, yet but enough on the walls and ceiling.  Hopefully I'll have some other models to actually populate a scene with next time.  Plants and rocks type stuff. Now that I've got some exposure to the method, hopefully I can scale back my goals a bit more.
