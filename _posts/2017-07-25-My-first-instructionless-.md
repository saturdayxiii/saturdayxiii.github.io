My first instructionless electronics fix.  Worked out purely by luck, but I typically can't hope for better.

Had a lcd driver board arrive dead.  With inspection I noticed that one of its chips looked damage.  I managed to find a chip online with mostly the same identification numbers and took a risk.  Lo, it paid off.  &hellip;it really shouldn't have though. I even ripped out two solder pads while removing the old chip.  That's probably the last of my luck used up for a good while
