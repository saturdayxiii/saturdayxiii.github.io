I've been addicted to [The Exploring Series](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheExploringSeries/videos) for a while now, especially for sleeping to.  I can wake up at anypoint and follow along with something interesting or just be soothed back to sleep.

The bulk of the videos are curated and explained [SCP Foundation](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/) stories.  I've tried to get into SCP before, and while I love the ideas, it can be a slog to try and find the good stuff.  TES makes it easy and is so well versed that they'll make you quickly feel like you have an actual grasp on the universe.  If only.

This particular tale I've chosen to start with presents the more goofy side of SCP, while still containing the Lovecraftian hallmarks.  It follows the adventurous Lord Blackwood as he fights religion in another dimension.
