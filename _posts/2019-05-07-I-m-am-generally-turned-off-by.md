I’m am generally turned off by popular opinion, and yet the broad-scope of my interests are undoubtedly pop culture.  So I have a lot of (experientially justified) hesitation when YouTube recommends me videos based on "my interests”.  However it has been giving me a few gems lately.  [Renegade Cut](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9infsKo33_2LUoiqXGgQWg) is a whole channel full of insightful essays and perspectives.  

I showed up for the Little Mermaid bait, I meandered for the dissection of “Christian Exploitation” films, I think I’ll stick around for everything else.
