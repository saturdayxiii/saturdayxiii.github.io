Okay.  It's been long enough for me to feel confident about my depression medicine experience.  I'm so.  So.  Lucky.  I'm just over 2 months in and I feel great.  Like literally, if you asked me "how are you doing?" I could honestly say "I feel happy".  That's never been the case, as far as I know.  It's been that way for at least 2 weeks now.  It's been a bit of a journey, so here's a break down.

- week 1: drowsy + insomia + poor apetite + can't orgasm
- week 2: drowsy + poor apetite + can't orgasm
- week 3: drowsy + lower sex drive
- week 4: drowsy to the point that I suggest to my doctor that I can't keep this up.  He says try another month...ok.
- week 5: I stop drinking diet sodas and start taking [Seed probiotics](https://seed.com/)  Two days later I feel amazing.
- week 6: No issues.  I have some trouble getting up in the morning, but I always seem to have enough energy in the day.
- week 7: Great.  I need to figure out if this is the Escitalopram, or the seed pills, so I stop taking the seed pills.
- week 8: Great, but i run out of escitalopram.
- week 8.6: I still feel great.  Not sleeping as deeply, but still lots of energy, maybe even better social performance than usual.  I get my pescription refil.
- week 9.2: Overly relaxed.  I'm stretching a lot and trying not to sleep in, but I still feel great.  I'm confident that my fasting from Seed pills and diet soda has done next to nothing compared to the escitalopram.

What a weird journey.  My last walk in got a different Doctor.  Even if I don't pay attention to the name and voice over the phone, I can still tell because new doctors always ask if I've tried to kill myself lately.  He said the typical protocol is to use the medication for 6 months, if effects have been positive, then stop...  Sounds odd.  I'm liking that I lasted 4 days without it, so maybe my chronic mental illness has a chance of correcting itself, long term, after 6 months of seratonin support?

Whatever, it's so amazing to feel like I always thought I should be able to feel like.  I'll take what I can get for now.  And I realize how super privledged I am to have things work out so easily.  I don't know what I would have done if I had to keep digging to find the right medication.  Maybe one more time, maybe two more times, to what?  Develop a habbit?  I mean, it took me 11 years since my last therapist visit to actually get proper medication.  It's a hard sell, if you don't know.

It sucks, but if you're in that position, please keep fighting.  I at least know that things that have always felt wrong do have the possibility of feeling right, so keep trying please.
