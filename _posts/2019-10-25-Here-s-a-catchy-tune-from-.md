<a href="https://umbromaniii.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Umbromaniii</a> and <a href="https://blindhandicap.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">bLiNd</a> keep putting out gold.  I could fill this whole blog with highlights from them, but my name is in the url so no.
Here’s a catchy tune from Umbromaniii that I meant to share when it came out, but I was too hyped up on bLiNd’s <a href="https://saturdayxiii.tumblr.com/post/186866959138/blinds-latest-album-takes-me-to-deep-dark-places" target="_blank">Submerged</a> at the time.  Now Umbromaniii has even newer stuff I should be raving about, but I’m dedicated.  I love these dark, hollow tunes.  Makes me feel like everything wrong is right.
