Just read through <a href="https://www.unicornjelly.com" target="_blank">Unicorn Jelly</a> again.  I have the hard copy, as well as To Save Her, but online is still the best way to read.  I wish I was smart enough to be able to have anything worth saying about it.  It opens so slow and simple, and ends so quick and complicated.  I’m amazed at how much went into the world, and how many levels there are to it, and how much I still get out of it on every level that I have in me.<br/>
