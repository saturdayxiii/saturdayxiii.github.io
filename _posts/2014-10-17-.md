I had watched a lets play of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/46460/Scratches__Directors_Cut/" target="_blank">Scratches</a> and another mansion horror game: Pineview Drive. I wanted to give Pineview Drive a negative review because it sucks and is pointless, but that would mean having to pay for it. I already owned Scratches, so lets give this game a positive review instead.<br/><br/>This game is great.<br/><br/>Honestly it's not for everyone, but seriously it's great. Unlike Pineview Drive there is an actual story with real weight to it. Everything has a reason and a consequence, and it's meaningful to a character that you learn to care about.<br/><br/>The game is slow, dated interface and graphics, and requires a lot of reading without voice over. That's a drawback to most people, but it's atmosphere is great and meaningful. It has a couple puzzles and very few jump-scares but they are in places that actually matter to the story and give you a memorable experience unlike a certain other game.<br/><br/>Scratches has a heavy story with not a whole lot of game action, definitely not everyone is into that, but this game is beautifully catered to the people who are into that. Great atmosphere, very immersive, great story.<br/>
