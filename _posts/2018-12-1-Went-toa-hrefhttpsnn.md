Went to<a href="https://nnedmonton.bandcamp.com" target="_blank"> NN</a>’s final show.  It was great.  Not sure if I’ve ever gotten “in to it” so hard at a concert before.  Probably was because of the great company of my best friend and my girlfriend.  
NN hadn’t changed at all since my girlfriend and I saw them while on our first concert date (excluding the concert we decided to start dating at).  She doesn't remember them.
