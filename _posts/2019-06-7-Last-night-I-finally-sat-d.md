Last night I finally sat down and played a bit of <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/sanitarium" target="_blank">Sanitarium </a>for the first time.  I’ve never felt a strong need to play it because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE50D27DF4F83907F" target="_blank">Adkit2′s 2009 playthrough</a> is one of my favorite Let’s Plays and I've watched it through countless times, night after night.

It’s definitely an interesting experience 

feeling through the clunky hit boxes for myself 10 years later, and finding little details that I didn’t pay attention to in the Let’s Play.  Plus, after watching a pivotal scene play out so many times, those progress achievements feel pretty sweet.
