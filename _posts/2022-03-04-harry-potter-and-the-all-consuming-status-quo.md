Shaun's back with another feature length explaination of how it's a mistake to expect that fixing people is all it takes to fix a broken system via the world of Harry Potter.  This was actually very insightful for me.  I had already agreed with the values, and it's easy to see the benefits of a working system from the top down, but it was a new angle for me to look at how only focusing on the issues of individuals can cause us to be detrimental to the greater good.  Putting a better person in charge of a broken system only works as a detriment to that person.  ...I'm not summarizing that very well.  Shaun said lots of really good, specific points about a variety of issues that I found extremely valuable to a comparatively under-assuming generalization of systemic problems.
