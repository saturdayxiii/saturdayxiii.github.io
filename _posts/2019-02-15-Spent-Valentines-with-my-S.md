Spent Valentines with my Sweetie, drinking coke and wine, while watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_(1996_film)" target="_blank">Bound</a>, presented by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HOMO-CIDAL-215031542009836/" target="_blank">Homo-cidal</a> at the <a href="http://www.metrocinema.org" target="_blank">Metro</a>.  All of my favorite things meshing together, it was more like my birthday or something.  What, Valentines is not supposed to be all about me?  <br/><br/>I wish I had the ability to take my simplistic thoughts and make them engaging like the movie did.
