Fermented Tofu, chao, turned out really well.  It's like a crumbly cheddar.  Super salty though.  I'd adjust that next time.  I followed this [recipe](https://fullofplants.com/how-to-make-fermented-tofu-cheese-chao/), but I fermented the Tofu for about a week, until it started to get actually moldy, then I used cooking sherry as the alcohol.  That's probably where the extra salt came in.  I think the sherry flavor was a plus though.  Totally going to make a larger batch next time.
