<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/291290/Motte_Island/" target="_blank">Motte Island</a> is alright, but there's a pretty big 

asterisk

 behind my recommendation for this game. It is fun. It has some memorable moments. It has a pretty good atmosphere. But I don't think I'm going to finish this game. 

There are two peevs that I've come across in my hour of playing. <br/>1: Enemies respawn when you leave the screen, but weapons don't. <br/>2: There seem to be some bugs going around. No, not the monsters. I stopped playing because my instruction was to find a phone in the police station and I checked every phone but no further instruction ever came up. I get it, they don't work. I knew that before I checked them, but what am I supposed to do now? I don't want to wander aimlessly around infinity monsters when my machete was taken away.
