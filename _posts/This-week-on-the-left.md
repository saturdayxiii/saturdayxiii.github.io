Shaun - Response to BBC Transphobia

Jacob Gellar - Time Loop Nihilism

[Thought Slime](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrr7y8rEXb7_RiVniwvzk9w) has a new podcast format this week.  A "Cringe Corner" with [CurioVids](https://www.youtube.com/c/CurioVids) Matt tells us about how [The Wim Hof Method makes us Super-Human](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgEwWWOlicE) and we get to react along with Sophie in this demonstration of the genetically gifted selling their privledge in a training package where you supposedly just need to work hard and be committed enough to obtain.

- [The Method and claims](https://youtu.be/fgEwWWOlicE?t=93)

- [Demonstration](https://youtu.be/fgEwWWOlicE?t=399)

- [Reflections and Examples](https://youtu.be/fgEwWWOlicE)

- [Scientifically demonstrated: inflimation reduced by optimism](https://youtu.be/fgEwWWOlicE?t=934)

- [the Bamboozle Flim Flam: identical twin control group](https://youtu.be/fgEwWWOlicE?t=1260)

- [the mocking begins... some more](https://youtu.be/fgEwWWOlicE?t=1354)

- [it's never a complete sham without bringing Jordan Peterson into the mix](https://youtu.be/fgEwWWOlicE?t=1568)

[Adam Something](https://www.youtube.com/c/AdamSomething) is promoting [Super Blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eIxUuuJX7Y) again.  Bonus this time, we get to see his face.  Does it match the voice?

There's an emotional look at the human impact in this short video; emphasized by eastern europeans coming out of poverty and being amazed by the ammendments of "Commie Blocks".  Of course, this could speak more about their state of poverty, but Adam is clear to praise diligent social planning as the victor of this scenario.
