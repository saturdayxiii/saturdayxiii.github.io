[Adam Something](https://www.youtube.com/c/AdamSomething) is promoting [Super Blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eIxUuuJX7Y) again.  Bonus this time, we get to see his face.  Does it match the voice?

There's an emotional look at the human impact in this short video; emphasized by eastern europeans coming out of poverty and being amazed by the ammendments of "Commie Blocks".  Of course, this could speak more about their state of poverty, but Adam is clear to praise diligent social planning as the victor of this scenario.
