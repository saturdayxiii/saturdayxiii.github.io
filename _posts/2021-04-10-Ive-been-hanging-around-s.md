I've been hanging around some ps1 communities, and no one talks about Sentient, but I still think about it regularly.  

SuperGreatFriend's playthrough is probably the most complete source of information out there for this game.  Reminds me of when everyone needed to use MikeNnemonic's LSD playthrough to research that game&hellip;  SGF got, I believe, 11 of the possible endings in the game, and there are still questions left unanswered.  This game probably deserves to be right up there with Martian Gothic, and Echo Night for ps1 story gems.  

Depending on your attention span, you might want to start on video 5 or 6.  There's a lot of false starts that are inevitable with a game this cryptic.
