I don't know why robovoice stories appeal to me.  I think the lack of inflection helps get across the actual quality of the writing.  But I'm probably making that up because these newer videos obviously have artificial inflection coded in.

There's always a mix bag of quality for youtube green-text story tellers, but I really like how chass has branched out into other areas of the internet.  I guess 4chan ran out of stories.  Makes sense.  

I enjoyed this story in particular for being such a macho ghost story.  Our lead character, Private Monkey, regularly acts in defiance of the supernatural, like an action hero, but the story still floats spooky.  It's a very appealing juxtaposition, and much refreshing after countless leads running and cowering whenever the unexpected happens.  Leave that to me, as I listen to this while under my heated blankey.

I'm curious how part two is going to go.  Part one here feels pretty stand alone and satisfying.
