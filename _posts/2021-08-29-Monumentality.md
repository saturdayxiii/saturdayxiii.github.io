This is a video by [Solar Sands](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR6LasBpceuYUhuLToKBzvQ) called *Monumentality* and it's top comment gawks at the creator's development 'from Deviant Art ranter to a sophisticated art historian". There is honestly no better way I can describe this video.  Other than maybe the details about it being over an hour long and covering ancient and modern wonders of the world, buildings, statues, cities, transports, space, and Star Wars.  It's epic.
