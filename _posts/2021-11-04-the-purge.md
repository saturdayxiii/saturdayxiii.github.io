WTF is this shish?

I've watched through both seasons of the Purge and I'm pertty confident... like, sure it's not for everyone, but "bloated and boring" Oh no no no no.

Sure, there's a fair amount of talking heads in season 2, but I've sat through boring never-intended-to-end netflix shows. I've given up on series that clearly were not going anywhere.  I stopped mid story [Scream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_(TV_series)) and [I know what you did last summer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer_(TV_series)) because this show was more interesting.

Nearly every scene has development and twists.  What pushed me over the edge to check it out was she fact that the series creator stepped out of the way to make space for minority writers, now every beat of the series seems to hit home.  

The two series are different stories. Each has a cast of characters that have independent struggles, then backstories, then they all converge in some contrived way.  But the action and twists along the way are constantly invigorarating.  Yes, some are predictable, but in a believable way... imo... that's definitely subjective.  But I was pulled in.... The ratings for this show makes it seem like few peoiple could be pulled in.  I don't think so.  It's realisticly not for everyone, but I love the misdirections, and how the plot went from inane action action slock to year long addiction, decentiztion, and balance of personal vs societal justice.... to action slock... the show was cancelled.  They worked with what they had.  Man, what a blast.  I can imagine where season 3 might have went with the attemps of recovery from violent addictions in a world were violence was encouraged within provacative, hypocritcal bounds.  Great show.  I wish there was more.

... oh wait, I've only seen 2 of the films.  Ka-ching!
