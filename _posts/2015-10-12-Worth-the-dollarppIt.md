Worth the dollar.

It's hard to review hidden object games because I don't really believe anyone expects them to be "good" games.  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/326180/Sinister_City/" target="_blank">Sinister City</a> is fine. It has other puzzles besides hidden object, but none of them take any more brain power then hidden objects do. Just color matching and what not. Great game for kids I guess. <br/><br/>The trailer for this game presents itself as something dark and dramatic, like you'd expect from other popular hidden object games, but really it isn't. The game is meant to be campy and tongue-in-cheek. All the jokes are pretty flat, but of course that fits the rest of the bill of a simple, casual, hidden object game. I had a couple of glitches, but they went away with a simple reloading of the game, so I can't really complain about anything here. Definitely worth the dollar if it's what you're into.<br/><br/>If you've played hidden object before, you know what your getting into. Nothing is advancing the genre here. If you haven't played hidden object before, if you're above the age of 14, you might want to start with a more interesting title.<br/>
