[iacon](https://iaconofficial.bandcamp.com/) released a guide to their 50 albums.  I've been listening for a good 6 months now, and they release a full length album every 2 to 3 weeks on average.  It's hard to keep up with, but dang, each one is worth at least checking out.

YouTube introduced me when Sugarfree was released, and I have to agree with Iacon: it's a favorite.  Definitely my most played.  I think the vaporfunk albums get the most plays from me, but I'm really enjoying the lyrics and tone switch in Epoch and Resonance, and you'd be selling yourself short if you don't at least give the death metal album a full listen.

I don't know what kind of magic keeps these albums rolling out, but I don't want to miss any of them.
