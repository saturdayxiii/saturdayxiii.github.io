There's a lot more to unpack, but as a priveledged median colonial person who doesn't get much for direct negative consequences from the US election, I have to say the moral blow is crushing.  [RM Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@rmbrown5736) has a soundclip of Trump saying "I did everything right" that sticks in my head, but now, as far as human values go, he's proven it true.  Trump is 78 years old and became president for a second, nonconsecutive, term.  He's been sanctified as a rapist, democracy subverting felon and the majority of people in the most impactful country on earth said "We want him to shape our world".  He's going to die soon, probably naturally (but even before July 13th I thought physical harm would be the best political move for him) and he's going to die happy and satisfied after a life of lies, theft, assault, and who knows what else.

Morality has been officially confirmed worthless in this world.

That's not me giving up and realigning my values, but it hurts.
