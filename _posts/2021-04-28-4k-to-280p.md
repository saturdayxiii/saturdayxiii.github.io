I'm very skeptical of the bandwagon that gets pushed along the "bit perfect" trail, and I appreciate the irony of these perfection seekers flat out decimating modern games to fit their nostalgia tastes.  That being said, I think it's still a super intriquing concept.  There are such cool things to see when somebody shows you what to look for.

Digital Foundry also did a great video from a developers perspective.  I like the potential this gives me to say it's the game developer's problem if my low-midrange pc can't handle the graphics.
"Just give me the downscaled, smoother frames!  That's easier for you, isn't it?"
