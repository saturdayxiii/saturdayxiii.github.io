Over the Garden Wall’s 4 issue mini series re-bound in an engraved aluminium cover.
<br/><br/>This is the second book I’ve bound and it has some flaws.  I think they can mostly be corrected if I get a proper book binding rod that extends across the whole spine.  
Double sided tape and industrial hot glue seems to work the best for holding things together.
