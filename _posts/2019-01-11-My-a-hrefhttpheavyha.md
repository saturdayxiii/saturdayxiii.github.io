My <a href="http://heavyhanded.ca/post/144167964597/designed-and-painted-some-modular-shelving-for-my" target="_blank">game shelves </a>are&hellip; Still really good.  But I'm interested in going "boxless&quot;for my consoles.
Someone in one of my gamer groups posted some kind of rack they were using and I liked the idea, but I don't know what the stand was called.  Wall-less shelf?  Pole shelf?  Google's not helping me.  
So here's a sketch of how I might diy the same concept.  Not so clear on what I'd use as the base&hellip; Which is pretty important.  But the shelves themselves look easy enough.  Maybe the shelves need holes so they can overhang the brackets&hellip; I've got some ideas for v2.
