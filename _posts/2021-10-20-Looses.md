I'm sick of always mispelling "loses".  Lose should be spelt loos.  It's not pronounced "L-oh-s".  Loose can stay loose, but when somebody "loses" something, they should "looses" it.  I don't think "looses" is even currently taken by a definition.  You can loosen something, or have it loosed, but not looses.  So let me spell it the way I hear it.
