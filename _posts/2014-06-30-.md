<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/259600" target="_blank">Indie 8ish-bit exploration into spider land</a>. There isn't much I don't love about this game.

Simple and classic. Gorgeous artwork, involving audio atmosphere, cute story, and an enjoyable learning curve. I've been sucked in

<br/><br/>It's not a complex game.  Point and click.  One of those ones where you want to screw up to see the death animations.  It works great, it just uses the mouse and what more do you need\[!\[thumbnail\]\(http://i3.ytimg.com/vi//maxresdefault.jpg\)\]\(https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v=\)><br/>Clearly I'm a little biased, but that's because I've enjoyed playing the game. There are many similar games to this in Steamland, and I enjoy most of them. So take this praise with a grain of salt if you are getting sick of these types of games.
