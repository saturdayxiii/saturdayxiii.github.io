<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/259600" target="_blank">Indie 8ish-bit exploration into spider land</a>. There isn't much I don't love about this game.

Simple and classic. Gorgeous artwork, involving audio atmosphere, cute story, and an enjoyable learning curve. I've been sucked in

<br/><br/>It's not a complex game.  Point and click.  One of those ones where you want to screw up to see the death animations.  It works great, it just uses the mouse and what more do you need? However, the game doesn't feel 100% finished yet. There are some animation glitches, full screen still doesn't work, and pixel hunting for fairies sucks, but these are some picky complaints. <br/><br/>Clearly I'm a little biased, but that's because I've enjoyed playing the game. There are many similar games to this in Steamland, and I enjoy most of them. So take this praise with a grain of salt if you are getting sick of these types of games.
