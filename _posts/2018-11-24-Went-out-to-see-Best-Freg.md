summary: Went out to see Best Fregiends Volume One with Greg Sestero in audience  It was rather on whim and I feel bad for the local chiptune show that realThe movie was decent too  Probably the only kind of role that Tommy can genuinely play  Movie came across as a very artsy production  Greg admitted I couldn’t bring myself to stay up for the sequelp
