Long over due for an update on my [iontophoresis experiment](https://saturdayxiii.github.io/2021/05/19/iontophoresis/)... it worked!

As pictured, I've "upgraded" to a full body treatment.  I don't think that is specificly working, at least not for everything.  Localized treatment definitely works best.

It took about 3 weeks to see improvements.  My feet aren't dry-blistered from being soaked all day, so I'm sweating less, and my shoes smell, like, normal bad, rather than old cheeto bad.  My girlfriend has complained of my overall lack of scent, so I think the bath is working as well, but after a couple months of just that I noticed that I was having to swap my shoes more often again.  So since I'm already well established into the process, I do each: a full bath, and a foot-specific bath, once a week.  That seems to give me the best coverage.

I don't think I have much specifics to add.  Other than, don't accidently use AC.  That was exciting.
