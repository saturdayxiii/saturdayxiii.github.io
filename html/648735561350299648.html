I think the lack of inflection helps get across the actual quality of the writing.  But I&rsquo;m probably making that up because these newer videos obviously have artificial inflection coded in.</p><p>There&rsquo;s always a mix bag of quality for youtube green-text story tellers, but I really like how chass has branched out into other areas of the internet.  I guess 4chan ran out of stories.  Makes sense.  </p><p>I enjoyed this story in particular for being such a macho ghost story.  Our lead character, Private Monkey, regularly acts in defiance of the supernatural, like an action hero, but the story still floats spooky.  It&rsquo;s a very appealing juxtaposition, and much refreshing after countless leads running and cowering whenever the unexpected happens.  Leave that to me, as I listen to this while under my heated blankey.</p><p>I&rsquo;m curious how part two is going to go.  Part one here feels pretty stand alone and satisfying.</p>
