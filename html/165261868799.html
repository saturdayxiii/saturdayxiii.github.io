Transporting Matt Perks’ idea has nearly eradicated the issue, and it’s also a fun simple mod to do.  </p><p>Just take out the hard plastic housing that the fan is mounted to and mount it with some packing sponge and double sided tape.  Easy peasy!  As a bonus, though completely unnecessary in the Dreamcast, but if your fan actually intakes air, then the sponge can also act as a filter to keep out dust.</p><p>I come from a background of high end speaker design where you depend on hard surfaces and solid mounts to drain vibrations out of a device. So the effectiveness of this mod is quite shocking to me, but makes complete sense in this application.</p><p>Highly recommended!</p> </div>
