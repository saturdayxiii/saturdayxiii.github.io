                    <p>I got my first girlfriend and lost my virginity at the age of 25.  Being in this kind of minority might automatically make my feelings toward sex null and void for the average human but I think I&rsquo;ve come to a certain clarity of something that I&rsquo;m vulnerable to.</p>
<p>It only adds to my problems but I was raised conservatively and it repeatedly disturbs me that I am not the first lover that my girlfriend has had.  I&rsquo;m like her fifth or something and she&rsquo;s five years younger than me.  I&rsquo;ve told her this bothers me and she cries and says she feels like a whore which I have to instantly rebuttal;  I know she&rsquo;s normal, it&rsquo;s me that&rsquo;s the strange one here. </p>
<p>Even though the feeling that we are on uneven ground is there, I&rsquo;m not wishing that I had more lovers. My analogy is that it&rsquo;s like we have our own books of love.  My book begins and ends with her.  Her book has four other chapters before my name comes up.  She&rsquo;s showed me that that example still sounds bad but I don&rsquo;t mean it like that. </p>
<p>What really bothers me is these first time and important experiences that I can only relate to having them with her and that&rsquo;s a big part of what makes them so special.  However, from my view, I can&rsquo;t understand how these things could possibly feel the same for her.  She&rsquo;s done them before.  She must have memories to draw from with other people and I&rsquo;m intimidated by that.  We&rsquo;re doing things together but my &ldquo;together&rdquo; must be different from hers.  Our first time together was my first time but just her first time with me.  This is my realization, that these feelings aren&rsquo;t about numbers of lovers or stereotypes or whatever; I&rsquo;m scared of our &ldquo;togetherness&rdquo; being threatened.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s unfair.  She&rsquo;s the love of my life.  She feels awful because I feel this way and she says she&rsquo;d change time if she could.  She promises that it&rsquo;s always been different with me; we have and we always will do things truly together.  I believe her.  She makes me feel better and safe.  I&rsquo;m just writing this here because I know the past always bothers me but if I can keep my fears written plainly and her hope with me, I can and will move on.</p>
