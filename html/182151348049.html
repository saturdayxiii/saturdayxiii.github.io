It has other puzzles besides hidden object, but none of them take any more brain power then hidden objects do. Just color matching and what not. Great game for kids I guess. <br/><br/>The trailer for this game presents itself as something dark and dramatic, like you&rsquo;d expect from other popular hidden object games, but really it isn&rsquo;t. The game is meant to be campy and tongue-in-cheek. All the jokes are pretty flat, but of course that fits the rest of the bill of a simple, casual, hidden object game. I had a couple of glitches, but they went away with a simple reloading of the game, so I can&rsquo;t really complain about anything here. Definitely worth the dollar if it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re into.<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;ve played hidden object before, you know what your getting into. Nothing is advancing the genre here. If you haven&rsquo;t played hidden object before, if you&rsquo;re above the age of 14, you might want to start with a more interesting title.<br/></p> </div>
