Hidden object, point and click</a>. If you like those, you will like this. If not, then no, you won&rsquo;t like this. </p><p>But what makes it a good hidden object point and click? I&rsquo;m not an expert, but I think I can say this was on the enjoyable side of such games. The graphics are pretty but the animation is dated. The story is followable (unlike certain &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; games) but simple and forced. The puzzles&hellip; there are puzzles! But their mostly chores and don&rsquo;t stand out as memorable or beneficial to the gameplay. </p><p>Ehh, it&rsquo;s a fine hidden object, point and click game. If you&rsquo;re expecting something good, you&rsquo;ll likely be disappointed. If you&rsquo;re expecting something horrible, you might be impressed. It&rsquo;s fine.
