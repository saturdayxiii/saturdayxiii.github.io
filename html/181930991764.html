But I&rsquo;m interested in going &ldquo;boxless&quot;for my consoles.</p><p>Someone in one of my gamer groups posted some kind of rack they were using and I liked the idea, but I don&rsquo;t know what the stand was called.  Wall-less shelf?  Pole shelf?  Google&rsquo;s not helping me.  </p><p>So here&rsquo;s a sketch of how I might diy the same concept.  Not so clear on what I&rsquo;d use as the base&hellip; Which is pretty important.  But the shelves themselves look easy enough.  Maybe the shelves need holes so they can overhang the brackets&hellip; I&rsquo;ve got some ideas for v2.</p>
