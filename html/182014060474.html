From a person who hasn&rsquo;t played this type of strategy game in a long time, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/311980/Isomer/" target="_blank">Isomer</a> is a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Gameplay?Â  Well, it functions. Things aren&rsquo;t polished, there&rsquo;s a lot of features that we hope to see included, and the control limitations take a little getting used to, but it functions, and it&rsquo;s fun. You play the aliens, invading from another planet, you fight humans, who are also invading from another planet, I guess. Gather resources, build your base, trade up your inventory, explore, and conquer. Some simple formulas done properly to give you great gameplay value.<br/><br/>Now the game has tutorials: personally I liked it better without them. I liked being able just to play the game. You got attacked in your base in the first 2 minutes of game play? That&rsquo;s the tutorial. Worked great for me. I had some questions about which actions should be prioritized, but learning that is the bulk of the enjoyability in this type of strategy game, and it&rsquo;s not hard to figure out by experimentation. So it&rsquo;s a great game if you actually like to learn while you play, rather than mindlessly carrying out instructions and quests. <br/><br/>Isomer has a simple style; rather cartoony. I like that. Night time is even kind of creepy the first couple times. First play through of Minecraft kind of creepy, but less impending doom. There&rsquo;s even hints of a developing story taking place. I sure hope that gets implemented more in the future!<br/><br/>I haven&rsquo;t played this type of game in a long time, and cartoony-ness doesn&rsquo;t ruin my immersion. These are pros for me. Beyond that you still have a stable game that will bring quite a bit of fun if you are into casual strategy.
