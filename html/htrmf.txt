hello /x slash since this is the place for creepy [ __ ] I thought I would share
0:10
with you all the story of a house my family moved into at the beginning of 2000 and lived until 2006 it's going to
0:18
be a mixture of stories from me and stories that my youngest sister told to me so bear with me I'll be typing all
0:25
this out so I'll be slow we first moved into the house at the end of January 2000 it's a three-bedroom one-bathroom
0:34
house with a full sized basement that sits off the road about 600 feet from the road it's in winston-salem North
0:42
Carolina and if anyone shows interest in it I'll post the address if you want to visit it it was supposed to be my
0:49
parents three sisters me and my mom's mother and dad but for about two weeks
0:55
it was just my parents sisters and I one of the first things we noticed about the
1:00
place was that the basement door was just two loose pieces of plywood chained together and that the basement had a
1:06
chalk outline of a person on the wall the house also had two chicken houses in
1:11
a fence about 50 foot away in the backyard on the side with the hill the backyard was split into a field about
1:17
half the size of a football field with forest at the end and the hill with the chicken houses on it which was in the
1:23
woods the setup of the house was you walk in the living room was right there
1:28
take a right about 20 steps in and there's a hallway with the bathroom at the end two bedrooms on the left and one
1:35
on the right the kitchen was off the living room with the stairs leading down to the basement and the back door
1:42
sharing the same walkway the backyard had a set of stairs so you could get up from the field and a lower driveway that
1:49
led to the basement then there was a block building on the right side of the house with a small basement that was
1:55
caved in sorry for the description but it's necessary I had the first bedroom
2:01
on the left my three sisters shared the second one and my parents had the one on
2:06
the right-hand side the living room had a huge plate glass window that looked out on the front yard
2:12
and the driveway leading up into the woods to a house about 1/4 of a mile in the woods with a farm where the Hells
2:19
Angels would throw a party every now and then there was also a creek that ran
2:24
past the farm and our property the first night we stayed there we didn't have our cable or anything hooked up or stuff
2:30
unpacked so we were all kind of just trying to get used to things I was 10 at
2:36
the time and my sisters were 9 8 & 6 we were all fairly normal though we were
2:43
kinda abused by our father me most of all but besides that we were a fairly
2:49
normal family for the first three nights everything was normal but the fourth
2:54
night our dad was gone to pick our mom up from work and I was in the living room alone my sisters were with my
3:01
grandparents for the weekend so I had free rein to watch whatever I wanted I was sitting there flipping channels when
3:08
I heard something hit the back door I remember jumping and getting up to see what it was and seeing an older white
3:14
guy in a beat-up green beanie a brown jacket and a red shirt staring in at me
3:19
he wriggled the back door trying to get in and I took off for the phone and called 911
3:26
what the address was but the operator knew and told me she had a car coming out and to stay on the line with her
3:32
while I was talking to her the guy had walked around the house and was standing in the front yard staring in with a
3:38
really bugged I look freaked my 10 year old SF he stood there a good five
3:44
minutes before he took off running then 30 seconds later a sheriff came pulling down they asked me if he was still
3:51
around so I told them about what happened and one of them radioed it in while the other walked around looking
3:57
that was about the time my parents pulled in the cops told them what was going on and my parents took me inside
4:04
while they looked around my parents grilled me on what had happened so I told them exactly what he had done
4:11
my father didn't believe me so when the cops came back and said they hadn't seen
4:16
anyone he had no problem beating my ass the guy actually ended up a big part of the weird stuff that
4:23
happened he would peek in through the windows at night at my sister's try and
4:28
get in the back door or front door if he knew you were alone would try and scare you by throwing [ __ ] against the walls
4:34
my sisters and I were the only ones to see him until my grandma did one night when she was alone said he tried to get
4:42
in and told her stuff he was going to do to her every time we'd call the cops they would
4:47
never find him and the times we tried to go outside and get him he'd always get away somehow we ended up becoming really
4:55
good friends with the people that lived up the road it was a family with three sons and two grandsons that lived with
5:01
them whenever we would hang out they would tell us weird stories about [ __ ] that happened around here hell the first
5:08
thing the grandpa told us was to stay out of the woods at night and to get out of them before it got dark because the
5:14
wood ELPS would get you we never believed him until my little sister and I were walking back home one night no
5:20
moon and there are no lights on the road we start hearing twigs break and whispering then start seeing little
5:27
lights moving through the woods we take off running for home and they follow us until we cross the creek then it stops
5:34
we never walk the road again at night unless there was a lot of us and we had a lot of flashlights and knives back to
5:42
the house the basement was the creepiest part of it the stairs had no rails there
5:48
were only two lights and someone had put a shelf on the right of the stairs and killed all light from hitting the corner
5:54
where the breaker was literally everyone who went in there got a bad feeling the
6:00
activity that happened down there would be low muttering footsteps on the concrete floor lights would blow and if
6:06
you were down there in the dark stuff would brush against you about two months in the realty people finally put a real
6:13
garage door on the basement but it would still flood if it rained hard enough whenever it would do that you could
6:19
sometimes see something moved through the water and the one time our father saw it he blamed water dripping from the
6:25
ceiling there's also a story my sister told me about the basement one day she
6:31
was home alone it was about the last year we lived there when she got the urge to go into the
6:37
basement she said once she was down there the wall opened up and something stuck its head out looked at her Grint
6:44
then started crawling out she took off running up stairs and waited outside
6:49
until our parents got home then had me go down once I got home to see if it was down there I didn't see anything but it
6:57
did feel weirder down there there's a story from where me the oldest sister
7:02
and one of her friends were hanging out in the basement her friends started shit-talking whatever it was down there
7:09
then both lights blew and something left wiebe lined it upstairs and stayed and
7:14
her friend went on to actually develop a really bad case of schizophrenia and shot herself about four years after it
7:22
probably not connected but still weird there was a van that came down the driveway one day when my youngest son I
7:29
were [ __ ] around outside I'd say I was 13 and she was 9 or 10 we were
7:34
walking up the road when we heard a girl scream from the direction the van went we took off running and hid in the woods
7:40
to see what was going on saw the van rocking the girl screamed again I told
7:46
my sister run home and call the cops so she did i sat there for a little
7:52
longer when the back door opened on the van and a guy looked out and around then got out and walked to the driver door
7:58
guy got in and left I took off through the woods back home sis had called the
8:04
cops but they didn't get there in time to stop him we're pretty sure someone got raped and we were too [ __ ] to stop
8:11
it I hope that's not the case there was one year when it iced really bad and
8:17
knocked the power out where we heard what sounded like a baby crying in the woods and we would wake up to claw marks
8:24
on the screen door another time something killed two of our dogs chewed them up really bad and they weren't
8:31
small dogs on the flipside of that we had an immortal rooster wild dogs would
8:37
get him and rip him up pretty bad then he'd show up a few days later perfectly fine one of our dogs actually got a hold
8:44
of him and bit his head almost completely off we tossed him in the it's in front of our house and three
8:50
days later he's back and pissed off my sister also got adopted by the weirdest
8:55
kitten I've ever seen it walked right out of the woods up to her sat down and
9:00
looked at her as if saying to pick her up damn thing was the color of fire with jet-black tips on its fur and the
9:07
clearest blue eyes thing got really big then just disappeared but now that the
9:13
little [ __ ] is out of the way I can get to the [ __ ] up stuff there was some sort of demon in the main house that
9:20
[ __ ] my family up we went from somewhat normal to me a [ __ ] up twenty eight-year-old that has
9:27
night terrors and needs therapy oldest cistern doubt the most normal but
9:32
was still [ __ ] a thirty year old at sixteen second oldest who can't hold a
9:37
job or a relationship has two kids and the fathers are [ __ ] then my youngest
9:42
sis batshit crazy PTSD schizo multiple personality my mom
9:49
passed away in 2011 my father is a cokehead now too in his own words keep
9:56
me faster than the demons this thing looked weird had a steer skull with blood that pooled out the eye holes wore
10:03
a black suit and would appear at all times of the day whenever he showed up
10:09
something bad always happened once he showed up and 30 minutes later three
10:15
guys jumped my father and almost killed him he ended up getting a steel plate put in the back of his head because of
10:21
it another time he showed up and not even five minutes later we got the call that our grandma had been killed my sis
10:29
that he showed up before she got raped and the one story I'm able to get out of the oldest is that he showed up the
10:36
night she was in a horrible car wreck that [ __ ] her from having kids he showed up to me one night when I was
10:42
working third then I ended up getting robbed and beaten pretty badly the one
10:47
time it ever actually touched one of us it was my youngest sister and it left a mark that's around the time she really
10:54
started having mental issues when it first started showing up is when our father started doing cocaine and other
11:01
[ __ ] again he done it in his younger years but had stopped when I was born he'd come home steal money beat my mom
11:09
and us and go off for days at a time whenever he was gone it never really
11:14
showed up but when it did we knew he was about to come home it seemed like the
11:20
more he did it and the more he hurt us the clearer we would see it and the more often our mom would see it but she would
11:26
pretend not to and ignore us if we asked her about it the last two years we were there were the most active times it
11:33
would show up and the last time we saw it was the day we moved out the moving truck stalled and we barely got it going
11:39
again someone almost hit us I figured it was just from our imagination but I
11:45
ended up moving back into the place for a few months in 2010 I lived there about
11:51
four months before I said [ __ ] it and the lease and moved out the guy was
11:56
still there me and a few friends actually ran out and tried to catch him with guns but nothing there was now loud
12:03
banging in the basement every night I stopped going down there when I did the first few times to see nothing but for
12:11
it to start back up once I was upstairs I came home one day to see someone
12:16
standing in the living room looking out my curtains but no one was in the house the night I woke up to my car alarm
12:23
going off and finding bloody handprints on it was when I said [ __ ] it and moved out now as far as I know no one lives
12:31
there and the place is in pretty bad shape when was the first time your
12:36
father accepted an event as paranormal it sounded like he was the type to write things off as with water moving in the
12:43
basement being a result of dripping water sounds like his energy was connected in a way to the demon drug use
12:50
ken exasperate encounters with dark entities to be honest I can't really remember and
12:56
I can't ask him because quite frankly the two of us don't get along and I don't approve of some of the [ __ ] he
13:03
does my mom finally admitted creepy should happened when I was older told me
13:08
stuff had happened when she was alone but would never talk about them damn that's pretty bad Opie did you ever try
13:16
to exercise it once the guy who came out to try was a Southern Baptist preacher
13:22
he did a walkthrough through some holy water around red passages from the Bible
13:27
it seemed to work for about a week before it showed up and that's around the time my grandma died everyone turns
13:35
out to be mentally unstable sorry Opie but I bet my money that there
13:40
were no ghosts in the house it seems like you are all genetically burdened by various mental issues I wish that were
13:48
the case but our family had no history of mental illnesses up until we started address Opie address is 49 27 bow
13:58
Mountain Road if you go don't go alone just for safety sake in case some
14:04
homeless people are squatting in it now got more stories not to be too McCobb
14:10
just human curiosity what were the circumstances of your sister's rape or other misery stories that have befell
14:17
you or your family that you attribute to the house a few stories as for her rape
14:22
she was home alone someone forced their way into the basement came upstairs
14:27
smacked her with something then proceeded to do it cops got prints from
14:33
the basement door and DNA but never caught anyone and yet the demon inside and the guy outside
14:41
something else that happened took place during a snowstorm that came up about two years into us living there our car
14:48
couldn't get up the driveway so my parents would have me bundle up and walk to the gas station about half a mile up
14:54
the road they had me go out one night because we needed kerosene to keep our heaters
14:59
going and toilet paper for obvious reasons it was around 9:30 at night so
15:04
it was dark but I started off up the road when I got about halfway past where
15:10
the crazy old guy let's call him Dallas lived and he walked out and called over to me to be careful because there had
15:17
apparently been an accident up the road I didn't pay any mind to it until I saw
15:22
the car off in a ditch and a dead deer laying not too far from where the road was it was apparent that the car had hit
15:28
the deer and then skidded off the road but by then someone had already gotten whomever was in the car I got to the gas
15:35
station filled up the kerosene jug and grabbed a few packs of TP then headed
15:41
home when I got down to where the car was the deer was missing with the trail that looked like something had dragged
15:47
it through the snow I freaked a little and spent my pace up made it home and thought nothing of it
15:53
later that night though I'd say it was about 2:00 in the morning we woke up to
15:58
something loud hitting the left side of the house nearest the living room our father walked out to see if maybe a tree
16:04
had fallen and hit the side of the house but apparently someone had decided to throw a severed deer head against the
16:11
wall it weirded us out of course and my parents called the police who took
16:16
forever to get out there they of course didn't find anything and told us to be
16:21
on guard every winter after that something similar would happen but not always a deer sometimes it would be a
16:29
dead opossum or raccoon or a rabbit need more stories o P [ __ ] had me up all
16:35
night and I need to hear more I'm trying to get my sisters to tell me any stories
16:40
they may have but they're either not answering me or being [ __ ] only cooperative one is my youngest and I
16:48
myself am trying to remember more stories because my therapist tells me I need to so that I in
16:54
own words can come to terms with whatever went on this isn't one of mine
16:59
but I got the oldest sister to tell me something during a call this morning she
17:05
said she was around 13 years old and home alone for some reason she went to
17:10
the bathroom which had a really small window in it right by the toilet and she heard something rustling around outside
17:16
she thought nothing of it until she got out and walked into the living room someone had thrown something liquid on
17:24
the big bay window and written I'll be watching you in it then something slammed into the back
17:29
door hard enough to knock one of the glass panes out of it she called the cops and while talking someone tried
17:35
sticking a hand in the window but the dog we had at the time ran up and latched onto it person screamed and
17:42
jerked their hand back but she said it wasn't a normal scream then took off cops got there took samples and pics of
17:50
the bay window then looked to see if the dog had bitten hard enough to draw blood which he hadn't they did find a glove
17:57
with hairs in it though that's all she'd tell me though sorry how [ __ ] up was
18:03
the skull any discernible features roon / cymbals
18:08
the horns were carved with something in a spiral the nose area looked like it had been crushed in by a hammer
18:14
it wasn't the white bones get when they've been Sun bleached either more like it had been buried and in the
18:21
center of the foreign area there was a mark but I don't recall what it looked like also my younger sister and I talked
18:27
earlier tonight and she brought up the creepy stuff that would happen after midnight if we were still outside I
18:34
remember one instance clearly and I'll shear it for background our bonfires
18:39
were usually after us holding a get-together of friends and family and eating homemade chicken stew and the
18:45
adults getting drunk and going inside while leaving us kids outside to dig around in the fire we would hold them in
18:52
the backyard in the field until one year our father switched them to the front yard in his words to keep a better eye
18:58
on you kids after we come inside my father didn't give two shits about us so
19:04
that caught me off guard at the time but I never put two and two together this particular instance happened in
19:10
late November of 2004 as a late birthday party for me as such my best friend at
19:16
the time was over to more of my friends the oldest sister had a friend over and
19:21
my other two sisters were the only kids there it was after 12 and we were doing
19:27
regular kids stuff when left alone with fire setting the ends of branches on fire and twirling them around making the fire
19:34
bigger telling stories and all that of course my sisters and I told them about
19:40
the wood Alps and how something creepy lived in the woods but they didn't believe us it was about that time we
19:46
started hearing branches in the trees rustle like a squirrel was jumping from them but there were a lot of them and
19:52
moving fast one of my friends had a flashlight with him and he turned it on
19:57
and shined it into the trees there were dozens of little eyes reflecting back from the shadows and he quickly turned
20:04
it off we all kind of looked at each other then a large branch flew out of the woods and landed not far from where
20:11
my sisters were sitting they screamed and took off and we were quick to follow we all ran back into the house and the
20:18
adults asked us what was wrong and we quickly told them what we had saw they
20:23
of course didn't believe us so we insisted that they go outside and look for themselves three of them younger
20:31
guys our mom worked with went outside with a flashlight for each of them and they scanned the woods for a good five
20:37
minutes before coming back to report they hadn't seen a thing the adults got mad sent us to our rooms
20:44
and that was the end of that before anyone asks the only reason I moved back
20:50
was because I felt like I had to it happened every time I moved out of state
20:55
the longer I was gone the worse I would feel but that could just be homesickness
21:01
or some [ __ ] also I have about an hour and a half before I got a crash so
21:07
I can share a few stories the neighbors told us for reference up until about
21:13
2005 to 6 they had a mini scrap yard of vehicles on their land on the side of the house the right side and then a
21:20
large two-story garage with an apartment over it on the left side with a driveway going around the
21:26
house and hooking up with the main driveway out of the W Birds behind the house is a large hill that
21:33
slopes down to some land and old Hell's Angel owns it's pretty much a bear strip of land a little longer than a football
21:39
field and about as wide with nothing but trees around it and a dingy little runoff pond with an old zip line over it
21:46
they also always always owned a lot of dogs at the very least six of them they
21:53
told us it helped keep away the Wood Elves to keep them from throwing [ __ ] through the windows or messing with the
21:59
people that lived over the garage also their dogs had a high turnover rate as in one would go missing at least every
22:06
two to three months unless it was winter where they would lose at least four before it ended they always had the same
22:13
breeds as well Rottweiler and chow chow anyway one of the first stories they
22:19
told us was about how one night after they had first moved in they lived there a good 12 years before we moved in two
22:26
of their sons had been chased out of the woods by the wood helps and the elves had started throwing rocks and branches
22:32
through the windows apparently they had saw one and decided to throw a thick branch at it they said it had hit it and
22:40
it fell over and started shrieking like a cat that had its tail stepped on and suddenly there were dozens of them in
22:46
the trees and bushes they took off running and they took chase after them I don't know if it's true but it sounds
22:53
like something they do I should make something clear the neighbors had their Grandma and Grandpa their two sons and
23:00
one of the sons two sons and his wife living there it was a fairly decent-sized house with
23:06
three bedrooms upstairs one down and of course the one above the garage one of
23:12
the uncles was paralyzed from the waist down and was the one who lived in the basement room with his brother and wife
23:18
in the room off of the living room the two sons in the middle bedroom across from the bathroom and the two
23:24
grandparents in the room off the kitchen this is all important later the house
23:29
had a lot of windows 20 in the first floor alone and a lot of them were at
23:34
ten foot off the ground the only rooms to have windows you could reach from the house was the living room bathroom the
23:41
kitchen and of course the basement room I became really good friends with the paralyzed uncle let's call him bill
23:48
because he was big into video games and [ __ ] one night when I was hanging out
23:54
with him he asked me if I wanted to hear about one of his creepy experiences and I of course said sure I remember this
24:01
part very clearly because up until that point I had never really saw a gun up close he pulled a pump-action shotgun
24:08
from beside his bed then pulled a pistol from underneath his pillow said he
24:14
hadn't had them for long maybe a year then he started talking about how one night everyone but him was gone it was
24:21
about 11:30 at night and he was playing something on a ps1 when he heard the outside basement door open up he thought
24:29
it was someone from his family coming home so he ignored it but then his doorknob started jiggling he picked up
24:36
the closest thing he had which was a 25 pound weight and got ready just in case
24:41
he said about a minute passed before it stopped and his door started slowly opening he said something that looked
24:48
like pic related walked in and stopped looking right at him he said that it had
24:57
looked confused to see someone in the room and he said that for some reason the way its eyes were freaked him out so
25:03
he screamed and threw the weight at it it shrieked and took off out of the room and out of the still open outside door
25:09
and he grabbed another weight in case it came back he had to sit there for about
25:14
an hour afterwards waiting for someone to come home said the whole time he could see stuff dart around in the
25:20
shadows outside said when he heard tires on the gravel he started yelling as loud
25:26
as he could until his brother and father ran downstairs and saw the open doors he
25:31
told them what happened said he wanted some guns and his dad literally went out the next day and bought him the shotgun
25:38
and pistol he said it never happened again though stuff would scratch at the window above his bed the sons first
25:45
story they told my sisters and I was about their first dog that went missing their parents insisted on getting a dog
25:52
for the two boys so they both agreed on a black ciaochao mail from the pound named Lucius the name he answered to
25:59
this dog loved them both to death was pretty much their shadow whenever they would go off to play in the woods around
26:06
the house Lucius would sometimes take off after something into the bushes every now and then but would never leave
26:13
the boys sight and would always come when they called him they were out playing one time a little later than
26:19
normal because they'd gotten a little Daisy BB gun and were shooting old cans when they noticed that the Sun had
26:25
started setting they took off for home since they were a good ways away and didn't want to get into trouble when
26:32
Lucius took off after something in the brush this time when they called him he didn't come back so they figured he'd
26:39
come home later and decided to run without him to keep from getting in trouble they said they were about 50
26:45
yards from the house when they heard Lucius bark then Yelp from behind them at that point they were close enough for
26:52
their dad to see them because he was waiting and he came running into the woods to see what was going on because
26:58
he'd heard it as well he told them to head home and he'd get a few friends to look for the dog which he did but they
27:05
didn't stay out in the woods for too long after dark so he told them he'd try again the next day he was saved from
27:12
that though when the next morning they woke up and the dog's collar was sitting square in the middle of their welcome
27:18
mat on the front porch their dad told them to forget about the dog that someone had found the collar and then
27:24
putting it on their porch like that meant that he was missing they didn't argue with him and they were too young
27:30
to really understand at the time I just remembered a good one for you guys I'll
27:36
tell you about the summer of 2002 that summer all kinds of creepy [ __ ] happened
27:42
but it all came to a head one night some idiot had wrecked his car into one of
27:47
the utility poles and knocked all power out for our area since it was summer and hot as hell we had to open the windows
27:55
for it to be remotely comfortable indoors both us and our neighbors had done this
28:00
before we tried to get some rest and this was about 12a and because we'd waited up to see if power would be
28:06
restored that night about 12:15 and this is what they told us our neighbors had
28:12
started hearing one of the boys outside calling up to be let in it was coming
28:17
from under the window in the boys room so it took a little for it to wake their father or grandparents up it did wake
28:24
the two boys up though who had thoroughly freaked out when it did wake their dad up he got pissed
28:31
thinking of course one of his sons was outside trying to get their brother to let them in so he opens his room door
28:37
pissed off and stomping toward the door that led into the basement he stopped when he saw his two sons stick their
28:43
head out and shake it them whispering that it wasn't them and luckily the voice called out about then as well to
28:49
prove it by this time everyone in the house is awake and listening to it and this goes on for about ten minutes
28:56
before it starts circling the house the dogs are going crazy bill is in the
29:01
basement calling out wondering what the hell is going on and it's just general confusion their dad decides to call down
29:08
to our house with their cell phone our mom had a cell phone for work and asked us if we would come get the boys because
29:15
something was going on my mom being the kind lady she was decides to wake our
29:21
father up and have him drive her up the road so they can pick up the boys he's of course pissed off that he got woken
29:28
up so he wakes me up really roughly to keep an eye out while they're gone they
29:33
get dressed head out and head up the driveway in our old Police Interceptor Crown Victoria our mom had picked it up
29:41
at a charity auction about five years before I loved that car I know the ride up takes a bit
29:47
especially at night because the road is really just a dirt road with some spots of light gravel and the rest being large
29:54
dips and washed out parts so I'm sitting in the living room with a few candles lit and trying to read to passed the
30:00
time at that point I'm the only one awake in my house with my sisters being asleep in the back
30:06
room on the far left side of the house if you've ever been in the middle of the woods when the power
30:12
out and there's a new moon you know how dark it gets I was sitting in the recliner across from the bay window so I
30:19
could see the headlights when they were coming in so that kind of darkness is what I was staring out at I remember
30:25
sitting there for a good 15 minutes waiting for them to get back when I heard the bushes on the hill closest to
30:31
the house move I didn't think anything about it because we got possum and raccoon around there a lot but I got
30:38
weirded out when it stopped underneath the air-conditioner in the living room it was a good minute of
30:43
silence before something smacked the air-conditioner great hard enough to shake it which made me jump out of the
30:49
chair and grip a little dinky softball bat the sound had woke my sisters up and
30:54
they funneled into the living room asking what had happened about that time whatever it was smacked it again causing
31:02
the three of them to shriek I being the oldest felt like it was my
31:07
responsibility to keep my sister's safe so I remember telling them to stay in the middle of the room that I was going
31:14
to check it out I grabbed one of the spotlights we owned walked to the front door sent a quick prayer then stepped
31:21
outside and flicked on the light to look around I took my time in looking in the front yard not wanting anything hiding
31:29
to jump me I'm not gonna lie I was really [ __ ] scared walking over to
31:34
the side like that balls are so shriveled it's painful fear I remember peeking around the side
31:40
slowly and seeing one of the little bastards running off towards the chicken coop that we were actually using to keep
31:47
chickens at the time I pretty much mentally said [ __ ] that and ran back inside and about then we spotted a car's
31:54
headlights coming around the bend from the neighbors we all stood in the living room and watched as they pulled in our
32:00
father getting out first and holding a shotgun the neighbors had let him borrow next was our mom who opened the back car
32:08
doors for the neighbors sons to get out of I walked to the front door and held it open the spotlight acting as a kind of
32:15
beacon and they all four ran inside our Father telling me to lock and deadbolt the door and for us to stay away from
32:22
the windows my mom told me to follow her to her bedroom while our father stayed in the
32:27
living room and she told me to let our two dogs out of their kennels while she got her pistol she'd gotten her permit
32:34
and CCW a few years earlier she was a waitress and one of her regulars became
32:39
a really creepy stalker so she'd gotten it for those late nights she worked she never let us see it so her doing that
32:47
made it click in my head that something was really wrong I let our two dogs out a blue merle Great Dane and a Rottweiler
32:55
slash Chow Chow mix and they were both tense as hell you could tell in the way their tails and eyes were we kept
33:02
hearing stuff move around in the woods outside for another hour before something hit the air conditioner again
33:07
except this time it didn't stop just kept banging then something started in
33:13
on the bathroom window then something started scratching at our front door that kept on for about two hours before
33:20
it started tapering off about then what sounded like a banshee wail came from
33:26
the back of the house we all nearly [ __ ] ourselves and I know for a fact that the middle sister did piss herself our
33:33
father grabs a flashlight and slowly walked into the back checking each room but he didn't see anything about that
33:40
time the power popped back on which caught us off guard but we felt better now that we had lights the neighbors
33:48
called us and asked if we were okay then asked if we'd heard the scream they said
33:53
a little before it had happened one of their dogs had gotten out and taken off running into the woods but then they
33:59
heard it Yelp in pain and go quiet they told us the boys could stay down with us
34:04
for the night then hung up I took them back to my room while my mom went to
34:09
sleep and our father stayed up and asked them what had happened at their place they told me that something had started
34:16
banging on the air conditioners then they had heard running on the front porch and something had tried to open
34:22
the bath room window their grandpa had shot it and whatever it was took off into the
34:27
woods they said bill had been screaming about something trying to get into his window
34:33
and that he could hear something banging on the outside basement door their dogs had started whimpering and
34:39
trying to hide so that's when they called my parents to come get them I'm gonna use a name just to help
34:46
differentiate myself from other Ananse I also feel I should give you all a little
34:51
more information about the rest of the property as I stated before there was a
34:57
large farm plot that was owned by a Hells Angel what I failed to say is that he also owned a lot more the large
35:04
football is field he owned and also a patch of it with a few older buildings on it in the woods while he didn't mind
35:11
us going onto the farm property as long as he was there with other people he absolutely hated us going anywhere near
35:18
the other places hated it to a point he started putting booby traps up to keep
35:23
people out he actually had someone that lived at the top of the hill with a decent view
35:28
of the football field that he paid to call him if they saw anyone on it also I should say that this Hell's Angel in
35:35
particular was named Joe Smith and he'd apparently run the North Carolina chapter for a long time the only reason
35:42
I'm telling you all this is so if you want to do a little background info to see if I'm bullshitting you'll see I'm
35:48
not one thing about his land though was that it didn't have defined borders and the only Creek that was on it ran
35:55
through his lens and ours so if you followed it you were bound to end up on his property eventually the only reason
36:02
I bring up the creek is because my next story involves it the creek ran from underneath the main road then snaked its
36:09
way through our land and Joe's whenever it was warm I would walk it and look for rocks and crayfish plus when I got a
36:16
pellet rifle I would hunt squirrels and rabbits as well once my youngest sister
36:22
got herself a pellet rifle she started coming with me one day when we were out we were in one
36:28
of the bigger bends in the creek and there was a small beach complete with sand that we decided to stop on for a
36:34
little break by this point I'm 16 and she's 11 and we routinely did this to get away from the
36:40
house as much as possible as long as we were out of the woods before dark we
36:46
were resting when my sister pointed out some tracks in the sand that stood out I stood up and walked over to check them
36:52
out and that's when it hit me they were baby tracks like a little toddler wearing shoes had appeared out
36:59
of thin air took eight steps then disappeared there were no tracks leading
37:04
up to it or away so it kind of creeped us out but we decided to keep going a little farther up the creek we started
37:12
hearing what sounded like a baby crying which sent me into alert mode because I was always told if you're in the woods
37:18
and you hear something like that it's a cougar I told my sister as much and we
37:24
started heading back when he neared the beach from earlier we saw more of the
37:29
little tracks and decided that we should be line at back home the whole hike back we kept hearing something move in the
37:35
woods and every now and then we'd hear the baby cry but we didn't see anything and made it back home without incident
37:42
I'll tell one more then I got a head out for the night that same summer of 2002
37:49
is when I started getting left home alone a lot for my parents to take my sisters out for stuff I didn't mind too
37:56
much because I could stay home and play whatever I wanted and eat whatever I wanted I remember this particular night my
38:03
parents had taken my sisters out to a movie then to a restaurant afterwards so
38:08
I was home alone a good four hours the oldest of the two neighbors sons was down with me and we were playing
38:14
something I don't remember what but we were in my room which was in the middle
38:19
of the house the way I had my room set up the bed was against the window I had my TV set up at the foot of my bed
38:26
and my closet was always open because I had an air vent in it we were sitting on
38:32
the bed [ __ ] around when somehow my TV comes unplugged we both wonder what
38:37
the hell happened and I go to plug it back in when he taps me on the back end points at the TV in the reflection you
38:44
could see someone staring in through my window I immediately flipped my [ __ ] grabbed
38:49
the softball bat and run out to the kitchen to make sure they aren't trying to get into the back door
38:55
meanwhile the neighbor let's call him Brandon picks up another bat and waits
39:00
in my room for the all-clear while I run into the kitchen I see someone run around the right side of the house
39:06
towards my front door and they start beating on it I yell at Brandon to go
39:11
call the cops and I run to the door to make sure it's locked and dead-bolted he calls to me and says the line is dead
39:18
we're on our own we're both freaked out the person is still beating on the front door we're
39:25
trying to figure out what to do so I decide [ __ ] it let's get some knives we
39:31
grabbed my father's big bowie knife he kept sharp for hunting some chef's knives from the kitchen we barricade the
39:38
front door and back door as much as possible and then we sit in the living room waiting whoever it is has stopped
39:44
banging on the front door and has instead started walking around the house hitting the sides of the walls at
39:50
various points occasionally they would smack a window but not too many times
39:55
this kept on for the entire time they were gone not stopping until my family
40:00
started pulling in the driveway we unburied the front door and that caused us to get questioned so we told
40:08
them what happened my father grabbed a bat and walked outside to look around while my mom called the cops to come out
40:15
they did took fingerprints from a few of the windows stayed out there until the
40:20
phone repairman came out and fixed our line then kept a car up the road in case it happened again this place holy [ __ ]
40:30
that's the place that basement sure looks a bit woodsy well I can tell no
40:36
one has lived there in a long time the middle room and the room on the left side of the house are the same color my
40:42
sister painted them when she lived there that was in 2010 up here went up to the
40:50
place and the guy who owns it was there told him I was there to look at the place because I'm interested in buying
40:56
then asked if I could take a look inside he told me to come back Friday with an appointment waited around
41:03
at a friend's house for a few hours to see if he'd leave in that time went back and he was still there as of 5:30 est
41:11
sorry I couldn't get in to take some pics this happened during the summer of
41:18
2005 I had a group of friends over to hang out with and play paintball with in
41:23
our woods all together there were 12 of us and of my friends had brought his little nine-year-old brother with him
41:30
because he had to babysit the part of the woods we decided to use was not too far from my neighbor's house and we were
41:37
using an old tobacco barn and house as our basis one on one side of the driveway and the other on the other side
41:44
we got started about 11:00 that morning and were planning on playing until about dusk when we planned on heading back to
41:51
my place to go our separate ways we're all between 14 to 16 years old have a
41:57
pretty decent knowledge base when it comes to the woods and we all have at least a pocketknife on us so we aren't
42:03
completely helpless we keep playing for a few hours and stop close to 2:00 to
42:08
take a lunch break and that's when a few of my friends asked me if the woods are always that quiet it getting quiet was
42:15
usually a sign that the wood elves were out and about and keeping an eye on things so I told them it happened a lot
42:22
and not to worry about it to keep from sounding crazy in front of my friends we
42:27
finished lunch then headed back into the woods for some more firefights fast
42:32
forward about an hour and we're both holding still when we hear one of the guys start yelling and shooting off into
42:37
the woods with his gun then the crashing of him running through the brush back towards us my team gets ready to light
42:44
him up when we notice there's blood coming from the back of his head so we call for a timeout to check him out and
42:50
see if he's all right we get him set down and start washing the blood off his head with a canteen one of our guys had
42:57
he starts talking about how he'd been in some brush laying still away from the rest of his team when he'd heard
43:04
movement behind him he didn't think anything of it thinking that it was some of his team moving up he said it was
43:12
about 30 seconds after it stopped that something him in the head hard enough to knock him out for a bit but he'd woken up to
43:19
something dragging him though the woods he said he raised his head and saw little stick bastards with vines wrapped
43:25
around his ankles pulling him and that's when he started screaming and shooting the rest of the guys laughed it off and
43:32
said he must have hallucinate it from hitting his head but he insisted that he knew what he saw I of course knew
43:38
immediately what he was talking about but still said nothing so I didn't seem weird I did suggest that we head back
43:46
early though just so we could get a better look at his head and make sure he was actually alright we start heading
43:53
down the driveway him between two of us to keep an eye on him and he's constantly looking back and around at
43:59
the woods with eyes as wide as a plate get about halfway down when he starts screaming and takes off running for my
44:05
house a few of the guys going after him but not able to catch him I look back
44:11
while the rest of the guys are talking among themselves and I see movement in the trees and bushes and I know then why
44:17
he took off running we get to my place he's sitting on the porch with a phone
44:22
in hand telling his mom to come pick him up the guys that chased him looking worried because they'd never seen him
44:28
act like that before long story short the Wood Elves tried to knock one of my friends out and drag him
44:35
off to do who knows what to him he ended up moving a few months later was never
44:40
really the same while he was still around refused to go near the woods sold all his hunting gear and would flip [ __ ]
44:48
whenever someone brought that day up I never thought I'd get this many replies holy golden [ __ ] plus since I kind of
44:56
passed out on you guys last night I'll try to share a few more stories to make up for it first one I'll tell is about
45:03
the night I spent the night in the woods by myself this happened about a week after my birthday in November and I was
45:10
17 it had already started hitting the 20s at night and the majority of the
45:16
trees were bare besides the pines I was sitting in my room digging around trying
45:21
to fix a ps2 a friend of mine had brought me to see if I could get it up and running again when my father walked
45:27
into my room and stood there for a bit watching me he started talking about how I didn't know
45:33
what the [ __ ] I was doing and that I should give up and since I was in my head working I said the first thing that
45:39
came to mind which happened to be to tell him to go choke on a dick he stepped over and grabbed me by the
45:45
shoulder and asked what the hell I had said so I repeated it because I figured I might as well dig my hole deeper he
45:52
took a swing on me missed and I took that chance to hit him as hard as I could in the jaw which ended up with him
45:59
falling through a table I had and laying there my brain then realized what I had done and I panicked grabbed an old army
46:07
Field Jacket I always wore into the woods and made a beeline for the front door then took off into the woods I made
46:15
it about halfway up the driveway before I realized that he'd know that I had ran for my neighbor's so I decided instead
46:21
to dip into the woods and go to ground in one of the old wood barn scattered throughout the woods the one I chose had
46:28
a little door on the back side where I guessed whomever had used it had put extra wood for easy access and the main
46:34
door which was made out of wooden slats both doors were relatively intact so I
46:40
closed up both and set in a corner to wait out my father I sat there for a good bit of time and started noticing it
46:48
getting darker of it getting dark out started sending off warning bells in my head to just sprint out of the woods and
46:54
take whatever ass-kicking I was going to get from him but by that age I was too stubborn to listen to anything so I kept
47:01
sitting there by the time the Sun went completely down I had been in the barn
47:06
for almost four hours and was starting to really get cold shorts and a field jacket aren't exactly great cold-weather
47:14
gear I started looking through the jacket pockets and luckily found a book of matches I usually kept on me if I was
47:21
going to be in the woods for any amount of time but I hesitated to try and start a fire thinking if I did someone would
47:28
see it and come looking the wood Alps weren't even on my mind at this point either since I was inside a structure
47:34
with doors but as the night wore on my brain started thinking on them that was
47:39
when I noticed that things were starting to quiet down in the wood around me being in the middle of the
47:45
woods at night in a building means you're sitting in pretty much total darkness which I will admit freaked me
47:50
out a bit but then something happened that made me almost [ __ ] myself I started hearing stuff moved through the
47:57
tree branches towards my hiding spot then stopped a good 10 foot from the barn i sat there straining my ears to
48:04
hear anything when something jumped on the roof of the barn sounded like something light almost like a squirrel
48:10
it was followed by three more then silence at this point I decide to say
48:16
[ __ ] it I'm getting a fire going and start trying to gather what materials I
48:21
could use in the barn by match light I managed to grab an arm full of old leaves some pieces of old wood and
48:28
managed to get a small fire going in what looked like an old stone fire pit in the center of the barn the fire
48:35
wasn't too big but it did illuminate the rest of the barn well enough that I could see if I was alone
48:41
luckily I was and the fire gave me a sense of security as well as helped warm
48:46
me up so I sat close to it my back against one of the walls that was when I
48:52
started hearing something digging at the roof if you've ever seen a hamster or similar rodent digging think of that
48:59
just a lot louder and about as fast I looked up towards the sound and that's
49:04
when I heard the noise at the small door on the back of the barn at this point I am more than scared and feel trapped
49:11
so I admit that I start freaking out a little I'm pacing the barn and looking
49:16
for anything I can use as a weapon when I remember that if it's the wood ELPS they're made of wood and I have a fire
49:21
going so I form a plan I start looking for a few sticks big enough to act as a
49:27
torch fine too that'll suit my needs then set about making torches I take off
49:33
my jacket then remove the shirt I was wearing then start tearing it into strips and wrapping them around the
49:39
branches then get both torches going I figured more fire would make them leave
49:44
me the [ __ ] alone at this point it's been close to an hour since I started the fire though and it's
49:51
starting to die so I decide to man up and take one of the torches and set just outside the
49:56
door to see if I can gather a bit more wood and fuel for it because I am not staying in the barn without a fire going
50:02
I stick the torch in a hole in the wall to act like a porch light then as fast
50:08
as I can I grab a couple big armfuls of leaves and toss them inside then grab as many loose branches as I can toss them
50:15
in grab two huge ones laying nearby to act as barricades for the doors then
50:20
grab the torch and head inside to set about work I should make it clear that
50:26
at this point it's about eight thirty by my estimate and I'm wondering if I have enough fuel to keep the fire going all
50:32
night I decide to chance it and start barricading the doors as well as I can with the two large branches I brought in
50:39
then sit down to wait me sitting didn't last too long as the
50:44
scratching was getting worse on the roof and at the back door so I took the torches and set one on each end of the
50:50
barn to act as a bit more light the scratching at the back door stopped as soon as I put one near the door and I
50:57
heard scurrying from it so I thought that maybe it had been a raccoon or possum and not an elf
51:02
that's when the scratching on the roof got worse and any thoughts of it being an animal left my mind it started
51:10
spreading out over the roof like it was testing for a weak spot and I sat there looking up and wondering if I was about
51:17
to get attacked from the rafters this went on about thirty minutes then stopped abruptly like it had never
51:24
happened I'm sitting there listening hard as hell and that's when something hits the wall where I'm sitting I jump
51:31
up cussing and almost pissing myself and grabbed another branch from the pile sticking the end of it in the fire and
51:38
hoping it catches on so I have another torch of sorts to use as a weapon that's
51:43
when I see a reflection coming from one of the holes at the bottom of the wall I leave the stick in the fire so it can
51:49
catch on then get on my belly to try and see what the reflection is coming from but it
51:55
moves before I finish and I stop dead knowing what I just saw I'm starting to
52:01
get pissed now because I'm cold tired and I really just want this [ __ ] to end so I walk towards the front door
52:07
move the branch from in front of grab the torch and step outside I
52:13
remember saying something about how if they wanted me they weren't getting me without a fight and standing there
52:18
trying to look like a badass whilst trying not to piss myself because what I'm doing is batshit stupid I stand
52:26
there about three minutes then decide to step back inside I turn around and
52:31
something smacks me in the back between my shoulders hard enough to almost make me fall and I spin to see if I can catch
52:38
a glimpse of whatever it was I look at the ground and there is a huge rock sitting there where there had been no
52:44
rock earlier so I say [ __ ] this and step back inside barricade the door again and
52:49
put the torch back in the hole by the front door that's when [ __ ] started hitting all the sides of the barn the
52:57
scratching on the roof got worse and I won't lie I pissed myself a little because I was in the middle of the woods
53:02
alone with little wooden bastards tormenting me this goes on until I'd say close to midnight and that's when things
53:10
got really quiet I mean the kind of quiet where you could hear a pin drop I'm sitting by the fire I've got one of
53:18
the bigger sticks close at hand in case I have to beat something with it and I'm telling myself that it'll be fine
53:23
they're just [ __ ] with you like the little [ __ ] they are it works a little and I start pacing just to have
53:31
something to do and so my legs wouldn't be cramped from sitting if I had to run it's quiet like that for close to an
53:37
hour and then it starts up even worse and there were a few times I swore I heard little voices coming from the
53:44
cracks and holes in the walls every now and then I'd see something dart across the holes closest to the floor but I
53:51
tried to put it off as seeing things then trying to rationalize that they wouldn't come in as long as I had the
53:58
fire going that lasted all of about another 15 minutes when the fire started
54:03
dying again I reach over to grab some leaves to toss on and I realized that
54:08
the majority of the damn things are wet so I switch my attention to the branches to see how they are sure enough most of
54:16
them are wet as well but enough of them are dry that I toss them on the fire to build it up more then move the leaves
54:22
and branches closer to the fire to dry them out that was when they started laughing there laughs
54:29
ound it like what you would get if he rubbed a chalkboard with sandpaper just magnified and all around me I take it
54:36
about five minutes before my brain yells at me to shut it up and I grabbed a stick out of the fire and wait to see
54:42
movement by one of the holes or cracks I didn't have to wait long and when I did
54:47
see it I jabbed the stick as hard as I could into whatever it was the end was still glowing red and when I felt it hit
54:55
whatever it had made contact with shriek like it was in pain then the whole wood sounded off with the same shriek just in
55:02
varying pitches that's when [ __ ] hit the fan something hit the back door hard
55:08
enough to jar it loose somewhat and something pushed the torch from its hole in the wall so that it fell out and hit
55:14
the ground rolling towards the center of the barn I pick it up figuring two weapons are better than one then I hear
55:20
something smacking against the front door I run to the back door kick it shut
55:26
and put the branch in a better position to bar it then toss the one stick in the fire while heading towards the front
55:32
door I kick it make sure the branch holding it shut is still secure then
55:37
grab the second torch and head for the fire I'm standing there a torch to
55:42
either side of me looking from the front to the back and just waiting for something to happen and something did
55:49
happen just not what I expected I started hearing my neighbors calling my
55:54
name and from the sound of it my father his best friend and my uncle are with
55:59
them as well the assault on the barn stops like they're listening to them as well and then I started hearing dogs
56:06
barking and getting closer I started yelling for them and that's when something hit the back door hard enough
56:13
to knock it off the hinges and break the branch acting as a bar I swing around and start cussing and do the only thing
56:20
I could think of I throw one of the torches through the doorway I see movement scatter as it sails through the
56:27
doorway and I take that opportunity to run my ass out a bear heading in the direction I hear everyone shouting from
56:34
we meet up not too far from the bar everyone is worried about me because they can see I'm freaked out and my
56:40
shirt is missing I just tell them we need to get the [ __ ] out of the woods ASAP the neighbors and my father are all
56:47
for it but his friend and my uncle are wondering what the [ __ ] is going on well
56:53
at least until we heard movement coming behind us fast and the dogs start going
56:58
crazy I look at them and say that they can stay in the woods if they want but I'm getting out of there and take off
57:05
running from the direction they came and they start following me the journey back
57:10
wasn't exactly quiet though we'd have sticks or rocks thrown at us and every
57:15
now and then something would call out from the trees ahead of us like they were marking our passing we get back to
57:22
the neighbor's house their grandpa is standing outside with an old shotgun and a spotlight we get inside and they ask
57:29
me what happened I tell them my uncle and my father's friend laugh until they see the looks on
57:35
everyone else's face we stay there for another hour then pile in my uncle's old
57:41
Jeep and beeline it for home I never stayed out in the woods again nor did I
57:46
even go into them for the last year we live there Opie I'm currently talking to
57:52
the owner here was his response to the questions I asked earlier I just need
57:57
you to confirm these as true and if not what is the situation a little over a month the last tenants lived in
58:05
residents several years ago this is a family property owned and passed to current owners via trust in 2008 it sits
58:13
on 1.9 acres and faces straight each property varies in bill cost according
58:18
to its size this being roughly 1,000 square feet the cost is very low
58:24
excluding insulation ie outdated windows and doors property
58:29
taxes last I checked was about 200 to 300 dollars yearly I haven't turned the
58:35
water on but piping appears solid and intact the home was built in 1961 the
58:42
neighborhood is quiet and peaceful a family-oriented community one mile outside the city limit perfect for
58:49
retirees and families as far as I know the house has been on the market for the time he stated and
58:55
the last tenants were myself and my sister once she took the lease from me in 2010 as to who owned it I do know I
59:03
know an older guy owned it when I was renting it but I did all the rental agreement stuff with the realtor the
59:09
acreage sounds about right and the house does face the driveway coming in I'm not
59:15
sure about the bill since I was there during the summer but it has well water at least it did when I was there the
59:22
neighborhood is quiet because hardly anyone lives close enough to it to have any problems with noise and the
59:28
community I have no clue about because it could have changed since I was last there I will tell you that the pipes
59:34
will more than likely need to be replaced though and new windows definitely put in because they're pretty
59:39
loose and some of them don't lock also have a short story about the demon thing
59:46
my youngest sister Lee er she's out in the woods near the house playing by herself with her dog she's maybe nine at
59:54
the time she says and she's just out [ __ ] around in the woods to kill some time until her mom gets home she's
1:00:01
playing in this little makeshift fort thing the neighbors and I made which is really just some smaller fallen trees
1:00:07
interlaced with branches thrown on them vertically to act as walls it's about midday early fall so the
1:00:14
trees are just now starting to turn colors she says she was sitting there drawing in the dirt when her dog perked
1:00:20
his ears up and started growling while backing up to stand in front of her she sees movement behind a tree about 15
1:00:28
yards away from her and that's when it steps from behind it and just looks at her the dog is going crazy loud enough
1:00:35
at this point that the creepy old guy that lived on the hill above us comes out of his trailer and calls down to see
1:00:41
if everything is okay apparently the demon looked at her held up a hand and held one finger up then
1:00:48
walked behind the tree and disappeared she waits a few minutes while the dog keeps growling then she takes off for
1:00:55
the house she gets inside runs to the room she shares with our sisters and
1:01:00
pretty much refuses to come out until mom got home except she didn't make it home that day
1:01:06
she was in a car accident that really just banged her up really badly and they kept her a few days to keep an eye on
1:01:12
her since the last thread was close to capping out on replies I followed in a
1:01:19
non suggestion and made a new thread for those of you just now finding this here's a TL DR my family moves into a
1:01:28
house early February of 2000 weird [ __ ] starts happening in the house and the woods demons and wood elves are involved
1:01:36
the neighbors up the road have some of the same happenings continue like this
1:01:41
until move out the first time in O 7 move back summer of 2010 weird [ __ ]
1:01:48
keeps happening I move out and sister picks up lease she ends up getting raped
1:01:53
in same house that's the short version sorry if I missed anything I don't think
1:02:00
I ever shared anything that happened when I moved into the place a second time let me fix that I moved into the
1:02:07
place the beginning of May 2010 at least I think it was May might have been April
1:02:12
it was supposed to be me and two of my friends as roommates but they backed out
1:02:17
at the last moment on me so I was stuck with the place to myself the old creepy guy still lived in the
1:02:24
trailer on the hill but he stayed away from me because I wasn't a girl he could look at it was myself and two dogs both
1:02:32
pitbulls and I had a few rifles and one pistol because second-amendment and I remembered all the crazy [ __ ] that went
1:02:39
on there the first time I took the room that had been my parents as my own used
1:02:45
the other two rooms as guest rooms and put my computer out in the living room so I could see when people pulled up my
1:02:51
washer and dryer were both in the basement so I had to go down there for laundry plus that's where the breaker
1:02:58
boxes first few weeks are relatively quiet - some bumps in the basement and
1:03:04
the occasional animal moving around the place so I wasn't too weirded out or anything but one night when I came home
1:03:11
from work that all started changing one of the first things I noticed was that all the lights were on in the place
1:03:18
which is something I never did to help cut down on the electric bill and that both of my dogs were on my couch that I
1:03:24
had sitting against the bay window their tails standing straight up and both of them looking towards the kitchen I
1:03:30
unlocked the door step inside and usually they would be all over me but
1:03:36
this time they just stood there staring so I slipped over to the gun case grabbed the pistol and chamber around
1:03:42
and clear the kitchen slowly making sure the windows are still locked and that the back door hasn't been tampered WI th
1:03:50
I go to turn my back when I hear something slam into the wall in the basement and my dogs start going crazy
1:03:57
and rush over to me I'm feeling kind of balsa with a pistol and two big dogs
1:04:02
with me so I slowly open the basement door and reach for the light then tell my dogs to go down they of course don't
1:04:10
listen to me so at this point it's up to me to fly solo and head down to check it out
1:04:15
I take a step onto the first step down and something hits the wall again to the
1:04:20
right of the stairs I freeze up then remember I have a gun and start making
1:04:26
my way slowly down the steps making sure to look around once my head clears the lip of the ceiling I don't see any
1:04:33
movement so I stop at the bottom of the stairs and look at the shelf to see if maybe it was a rat or something don't
1:04:40
see anything figure it was a pipe slamming against the wall and start heading upstairs when something hits the
1:04:46
far wall where there are no pipes I spin with the pistol raised and see nothing at that point I say [ __ ] this head
1:04:55
upstairs lock the basement door and put a kitchen chair up against it to act as a secondary barricade then hook the dogs
1:05:02
up to a leash grab a rifle and head outside to see if someone had been throwing stuff against the walls the
1:05:09
dogs are fine at this point so I put one of them on a tether I kept in the front yard that allowed them to run the entire
1:05:16
length of the front yard then take the other one with me as I check the back yard my dumb ass gets back there and
1:05:23
realizes I don't have a light to see so I stand there for a few minutes to see the dog picks anything up but nothing
1:05:30
happens so I head back around grab the other dog and head inside I said about
1:05:36
making dinner with my pistol close at hand some music on and the living room
1:05:41
and kitchen lights on when the power in the entire house dies I cuss because I cut my finger when it went off grab a
1:05:48
bandage and a light then unblock the basement door to go see if the breaker flipped or if someone had downed a line
1:05:54
the dogs are whining for some reason that I didn't find out until later but I
1:05:59
ignore it as I step into the basement I shine the light around in the dark to make sure no one was down there then
1:06:06
start walking behind the shelf to get to the breaker box I'm almost there when I
1:06:11
feel something tug on the bottom of my shirt and I instinctively looked down I don't see anything but I'm freaked out a
1:06:19
bit speed walked the rest of the way to the breaker see that none of them are flipped then turn around to head back
1:06:25
upstairs when I turned I swore I saw someone standing at the end of the shelf
1:06:31
and I could hear the dogs at the top of the steps whining and growling so I hurried up the stairs locked and barred
1:06:38
the door then called The Electric Company on my shitty cricket phone I tried a few times to connect but each
1:06:45
time the reception was worse and worse until the phone itself just died so I start getting some clothes ready so I
1:06:51
could go to my mom's place until morning the whole time I'm moving around the dogs are on my tail still whining and
1:06:59
growling so I finally tell them to shut the hell up because it's pissing me off and that's when I saw movement in the
1:07:06
living room the dogs start going ballistic their first standing on end and their tails tucked between their
1:07:12
legs I'm mentally cursing myself because I left my pistol in the kitchen and the
1:07:17
gun cabinet is in the living room leaving me nothing but a Maglite and two dogs to fight with then as quickly as
1:07:24
the dog started going nuts they fall silent and kind of just fall asleep on the spot that scares the hell out of me
1:07:32
but the next thing is even worse the [ __ ] demon walks out of my kitchen holding my pistol in what I can only
1:07:39
describe as a distasteful way like it didn't like what it was holding it looks up at me holds its freehand up
1:07:46
and does that tisk tisk movement with its trigger finger it lays the gun on top of my gun cabinet walks towards the
1:07:54
door and then the power snaps back on and the dogs wake up looking around confused I walk slowly out to the living
1:08:01
room and look around not knowing what to expect but everything is normal I grab
1:08:07
the pistol and look it over nothing looks wrong with it but I decide I'll take it apart and make sure it's okay
1:08:13
the next day i hook my phone up long enough to get it charged to make a call wake my mom up at 12:30 at night and ask
1:08:20
if I can come crash at her place for the night with the dogs she instantly says
1:08:25
yes because and in her words I sounded scared to death and my voice was shaking
1:08:31
pack a bag grab my guns and the dogs pile in my Jeep and head to her house
1:08:37
her and my father gave me a lot of weird looks as I was transferring guns into the house but I never told them exactly
1:08:44
what happened someone asked for another story so I'll share another from the
1:08:50
second time I lived there this happened a week after the power incident I was
1:08:56
off work that day and had a few friends over to shoot the [ __ ] and chill as we hadn't seen each other in a long time
1:09:02
there was myself two of my friends and one of their girlfriends we're all
1:09:08
sitting around smoking and generally having a good time when something starts knocking around in
1:09:14
the basement it freaks them out and they ask what the hell it was I laugh it off
1:09:20
and tell them about the thing that haunts the place and they kind of laugh it off because they think I'm
1:09:25
bullshitting them it keeps happening every few minutes and finally one of my
1:09:30
friends asks me why I'm not checking it out I shrugged and told him it's because it's nothing but if he wants to check it
1:09:37
out he can do it he says fine walks into the kitchen and unlocks the basement
1:09:43
door and starts down the stairs we hear him get about halfway down and stop then
1:09:49
something that sounds huge hits the basement wall and he starts cussing and running up the stairs saying I should
1:09:54
play tricks on him like that I ask him what he means and he tells me it's
1:10:00
[ __ ] up to put a mannequin with a steer skull on it by the shelf and that I knew it was nothing and tricked him
1:10:05
into going down at that I visibly pale because besides my family no one has
1:10:11
seen it and he takes me going pale as a sign of guilt and pushes the subject I get up push past him and head downstairs
1:10:18
with him and the other two following me and he's running his mouth until we're all in the basement he starts cussing
1:10:25
and asking how I hit it so fast because he wasn't too far behind me and I just looked back at him and tell him that
1:10:32
what he saw was the thing haunting the place even tell him to walk around the Shelf if he doesn't believe me he does
1:10:39
so sees nothing back there and turns to me slowly then asks what the hell he
1:10:44
just saw I explained to him what all I know about it and what usually happens when it shows up and he starts freaking
1:10:52
out and runs upstairs and out to his car cranks it up and speeds out of the driveway the rest of us get out of the
1:10:59
basement and head back to the living room my friend's girlfriend asks me to tell her a little about the stuff that
1:11:05
happened so I do about halfway through the story we get a call from the friend
1:11:10
that left that he was heading to the hospital because his younger brother had been in a really bad mountain bike
1:11:15
accident and the last thing he said to me was that I should move the [ __ ] out of the house before something happened
1:11:21
later that evening after everyone had left I was sitting at the computer when I saw movement behind me in the screen I
1:11:29
turned slowly and the damn thing is standing in the hallway with its arms outstretched and I got the feeling it
1:11:36
was trying to tell me that what had happened wasn't meant to happen to my friend it turned walked into the middle room
1:11:43
and the dogs came running out of my room into it whining and growling the guy's
1:11:48
brother ended up being ok just some broken ribs and a couple deep lacerations on his torso and one on his
1:11:54
phorid but he never came back over to the house always had me come to his place or meet somewhere I've one more
1:12:02
story in me then I really need to get some rest for tomorrow not really
1:12:07
looking forward to go in the place to be honest with you guys I think I'll tell you all about the
1:12:13
event that made me move out this was a little over four months into my lease and even though I was getting used to
1:12:20
things I was getting tired of being woken up or coming home to [ __ ] being messed up at this point my dogs were at
1:12:27
my mother's because of an earlier incident so it was just myself in the house it was about 1:30 ish at night and
1:12:34
I'd finally fallen asleep to the sound of more and heavier thuds in the basement I was exhausted from work and
1:12:41
figured if something was gonna kill me it was going to have one hell of an easy time doing so I was nice and cozy in my
1:12:48
bed and dead asleep when I woke up abruptly because I felt someone standing over me reach over and switch on my lamp
1:12:55
and of course no one is there but the feeling isn't going away I sit up and
1:13:01
look around and notice my bedroom door is open a bit I always closed and locked
1:13:06
it as a just in case so I grab my pistol from the side table chamber around and
1:13:12
slowly make my way to the door I get to it and slowly push it open with my free
1:13:17
hand finger on the trigger in case something tried to jump me but nothing happened I did a quick search of the
1:13:25
house made sure the windows that could lock were still locked and made sure my ghetto alarms on the ones that couldn't
1:13:31
lock were still good ghetto alarms equal string and lots of cans I get back to my room lay down and
1:13:38
turn off the lamp and just lay there a good 45 minutes passed and I'm almost
1:13:44
back asleep when I hear what sounds like shrieks coming closer to the house from the backyard I'm laying there listening
1:13:51
and they're definitely getting closer to the house whatever is making them stops
1:13:56
underneath my window then darts in the direction of the front yard I'm sitting
1:14:01
there wondering what the [ __ ] that was because it's something new when I start hearing a weird laughing noise coming
1:14:07
from the driveway I grab the pistol walk out into the living room and turn on the
1:14:13
porch light to see movement behind my car I call out that I have a gun and that whoever it is needs to step away
1:14:19
from my car or I'll shoot the laughing stops and then my power goes
1:14:24
out leaving me standing in the dark with a crazy someone or something in my driveway I hear movement and see
1:14:31
something walking around my car and making its way up through the yard and I call out once more that I'll shoot thing
1:14:38
takes off running at me I squeeze the trigger three times in quick succession and whatever it is takes off shrieking
1:14:45
across the driveway into the field on the other side the power decides to turn
1:14:50
back on then and the crazy old guy neighbor I had comes running down the hill with an old rifle yelling about
1:14:56
what the [ __ ] I was shooting at to something in the morning I tell him someone was [ __ ] with my car and he
1:15:02
comes walking up and switches on an old flashlight one of the ones with the huge battery on it and pans it over my car
1:15:09
there's red handprints all over the damn thing and I think it was someone screwing with me until the old guy wipes
1:15:16
a little off smells it and gags then has me smell it turns out the red stuff was
1:15:22
old blood the cops got there about eight minutes later the old guy having called
1:15:27
911 off the receiver so he could run out and check on whatever was happening we
1:15:34
both get ordered to drop our guns and we do so and then they walk up with guns drawn asking what the hell the shooting
1:15:40
was about I start telling them and when I get to the part about shooting at someone two of the cops start walking
1:15:47
around my yard looking for a blood trail I get questioned for a good hour while they bring in a k-9 unit because
1:15:53
apparently they'd found a trail but the dogs lost it in the field I get hauled
1:15:58
into the station and questioned more my pistol gets taken from me as evidence and for all intents and purposes I'm
1:16:06
held that night in jail as a precaution in the morning they apologize tell me I
1:16:11
can come back in two weeks to get my pistol and send me on my way my damn car
1:16:17
was impounded as well so they could gather the blood off as evidence so I ended up having to call a friend to come
1:16:23
pick me up which was awkward having to explain to him what had happened I get
1:16:28
back to the house check everything out then start packing my [ __ ] and looking for a place to crash until I can find a
1:16:35
new place when I went back to the station later to get the pistol and my car I asked them
1:16:41
if they'd had any luck finding out anything the cop looked up at me and said it was best not to think about it
1:16:47
and that I should probably look for a new home to know if that means they knew something about what happened or not but
1:16:54
I'm almost positive they did drop AG here Oh P can you give a full description of
1:17:00
steer skull demon you mentioned you've caught long glimpses of him before and your sisters in full daylight you
1:17:08
recalled his head isn't clean it's like he's been buried and rotted what's his
1:17:13
suit like same deal musty and buried looking or clean and tailored what color
1:17:20
how many buttons ty vest did he have
1:17:25

1:17:31
deal a three-piece black nicely tailored besides looking like it's been through
1:17:37
hell it had hens but they looked burnt from what I saw of the vest it was the
1:17:43
same black as the jacket ty fluctuated between black and red depending on who saw it as for the amount of buttons I
1:17:51
think it had four buttons on it sorry about the wait car broke down when I
1:17:57
left the place pick dump commencing and sorry for the [ __ ] quality
1:18:09
front door was unlocked the back door was kicked open found this
1:18:17
in the closet of the polka dot room I don't remember us drawing or writing that said something like we love you
1:18:24
Blackie or some [ __ ] the basement stairwell I apologize for
1:18:29
the shitty quality of these last three pictures I just really did not want to be down there by myself also it seems
1:18:36
like someone painted over the outline that back wall is where it was last
1:18:42
picture I took I'll try to go back this weekend during the day and with someone
1:18:47
I'm really sorry about how shitty these three are please understand that I
1:18:52
really didn't want to be there any longer than I had to now don't worry about it
1:18:58
I got a question though would you say those wood elfs look like tiny versions of Groot only similarity between them
1:19:05
and Groot is the wooden body they looked more like pink related do y'all want a
1:19:12
few more stories tonight or can I take a rest and just get shit-faced or I could do both it's whatever not
1:19:20
like I'm sleeping tonight [ __ ] it both it is then I'll start with
1:19:26
another one from where I live there the second time at the time I had a girlfriend that didn't live too far from
1:19:32
me and sometimes she would come over and spend the night with me because between work and life we rarely saw one another
1:19:39
one night we're both in bed and I'm passed out cold and she shakes me awake and puts a hand over my mouth
1:19:46
this freaks me out because I've just been woke up and it's pitch black in the room and I'm in a freaky ass house but I
1:19:53
calm down when I realize it's her and I asked her what the hell she's doing she
1:19:59
does the SH H motion and leans in close and whispers that she'd abruptly woken up and seen someone standing in the
1:20:05
hallway she liked to keep the bedroom door open at night so her dog could come and go as she pleased I immediately
1:20:12
think someone's in the house and grab my pistol slide out of bed then step over
1:20:17
to the door as Italy as I can so whoever is out there won't hear me peek my head around the
1:20:23
corner don't see anything so I step into the hall fully and start heading towards the living room one of my dogs is with
1:20:31
me and he kind of perks his ears up and starts that low growling so I have a feeling I know what she saw I step into
1:20:39
the living room look around and see movement outside at the very edge of the light from the front porch so I walk
1:20:46
over to the front door check it to make sure it's locked then make my way to the back door to check it as well I step
1:20:53
into the kitchen and hear something moving down the stairs so I stop because I know there's a good chance that it's
1:20:59
the demon [ __ ] with me but I gotta check just to make sure step to the
1:21:04
salmon door move the chair unlock it and fling it open because I'm tired and just
1:21:10
want this to stop flip the light on look down the stairwell get a cold chill so I try to
1:21:17
make the dog go down first but he refuses to so I say [ __ ] it and start walking down I hit the bottom of the
1:21:25
steps look around walk around the shelf to make sure no one is hiding behind it
1:21:30
then start walking upstairs cause I'm naked and the cold ass basement isn't doing me any favors when something slams
1:21:37
into the outside basement door hard enough to shake if I beeline it upstairs flip on the outside lights unlock the
1:21:45
back door and I'm outside with all three dogs pushing past me to chase after whatever it was my girlfriend walks to
1:21:52
the doorway and asks if I think she should call the cops but I tell her not to worry about it because they won't
1:21:58
find anything she looks at me kind of funny for a little then goes back to the
1:22:03
bedroom as I try to get the dogs inside I hear them chasing something up the
1:22:08
road for a little ways and then they finally come running back and get straight inside the house like they're
1:22:14
scared I shrug close up the back door and relock and barricade it and the
1:22:19
basement door turn the living room light on then go get dressed because I know I'm not sleeping anytime soon I end up
1:22:27
actually passing out in my chair and getting woken up in the morning by my girlfriend asking why I came
1:22:32
back to the living room last night I asked what she meant and she said I'd
1:22:37
come into the room when she was half asleep and lay down with her just so I wouldn't freak her out I told her I'd
1:22:44
heard something outside and wanted to make sure no one was trying to break into the house and it seemed like she
1:22:50
accepted it not really scary but still next one coming up this is something
1:22:57
that happened one day when it was just the three girls and I home can't remember if it was December oh three or
1:23:03
January oh four it's also the first time the two oldest girls got a good look at
1:23:09
the wood elves we're all four in the backyard digging around in the snow having a snowball fight and just
1:23:15
generally being kids it's a little before noon and we all decide to go in
1:23:21
and warm up a bit and grab something to eat before getting back to pelting each other with snowballs we're all sitting
1:23:27
in the living room around our kerosene heater the place has baseboard heaters but they didn't work when the oldest sister
1:23:34
points out of the window towards the field across from the house and asks what's making the tree limbs move up and
1:23:40
down I tell her it's probably a squirrel or something but she insisted that it
1:23:45
was something else because she couldn't see the squirrel I tell her fine let's
1:23:50
all get dressed and we'll go check it out before heading around back to continue our battle so we all bundle up
1:23:57
and set off out the door and down the front yard get to the edge of our yard and stop and the movement in the tree
1:24:04
starts getting closer and closer a few bouncing tree branches later and whatever is moving stops in one of the
1:24:11
pines closest to us we're staring up at it wondering if whatever is causing it
1:24:16
will show itself when one of the little bastards pokes its head through the pine needles and look straight at us we're
1:24:22
all standing there dumbstruck me because I hadn't seen one that close and then because they never actually saw one
1:24:28
before when another one not too far from the first one kind of shimmies onto a branch and stands up looking at us the
1:24:36
middle sister let's call her Bessie says something along the lines of she doesn't like the way they're looking at us
1:24:42
reaches down and scoops up some snow packs it into a snow and throws it at the one in the pine
1:24:48
tree I call her an idiot and the youngest sister let's call her Marie elbows her and yells that she shouldn't
1:24:56
do that while the oldest has pretty much nope inside the house without saying a word Bessie said something along the
1:25:03
lines that she doesn't care what they are she doesn't like the way they look so she's going to do whatever she wants to
1:25:09
do to them then leans down to scoop up another handful of snow I look up and
1:25:14
see that both the elves are gone and I get a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach and tell the two girls we should
1:25:20
get inside with Marie agreeing but Bessie saying screw that because she wants to hit them again about that time
1:25:27
Iraq about the size of a golf ball comes flying out of the woods and smacks Bessie right in the forehead and
1:25:32
actually draws a little blood and she starts screaming bloody murder and throws the snowball in the direction it
1:25:38
came from and shouting about how she'll burn all the little butt holes for hurting her out flies another Rock and
1:25:45
gets her in almost the same place as the first one and at this point I look at Marie and it's like an unspoken
1:25:51
agreement between us that we should just leave Bessie - whatever they're going to do to her we didn't like Bessie and she
1:25:59
didn't like us but she's only a half-sister so [ __ ] her we turn tail and start off for the house and Bessie
1:26:06
realizes what we're doing she runs and tackles Marie saying that if she gets
1:26:11
hurt by them then Marie is too so I turn around kick her off Marie scoop her up
1:26:17
and take off to the house yeah I'm a shitty person for that but [ __ ] Bessie
1:26:22
seriously Marie and I still don't get along with her at all and the oldest
1:26:28
sister just tolerates her anyway back to the story Bessie is crying because I
1:26:34
kicked her and there's now a steady stream of rocks flying at her and hitting her in the back and head and you
1:26:40
can see that some of the ones hitting her head are making her bleed I get back to the house and said Marie down then
1:26:46
turned back to watch Bessie struggle up the front yard the rock barrage starting to die down and she's looking at me with
1:26:54
these hurt filled eyes like she's begging me to come help her I'm not really proud of what I did next
1:27:00
but I remember closing the door and locking it then drawing the blinds Murray and the oldest sister let's call
1:27:07
her Nicole start screaming at me to let her in because she's our sister and how could I be such a cold-hearted person I
1:27:14
just shrug and say that she started it and deserves whatever she got then go to the bathroom to take a piss while I'm in
1:27:22
there they let Bessie in and you can hear her crying and asking for our mom and saying she was going to tell our
1:27:28
Father what I did but to keep from getting a worse ass beating than what I was already going to get I went ahead
1:27:34
and cleaned up the cuts she'd gotten fast forward to three hours later and our parents are pulling in the driveway
1:27:41
in our uncle's Jeep Bessie runs outside instantly to tell them what happened and
1:27:46
I can see the look on our father's face thinking I'd done the cuts he starts off
1:27:52
toward the house and about that time and other rock flies out of the woods and smacks Bessie in the jaw and she starts
1:27:59
bawling our mom and uncle saw it and think I'm in the woods until I walk out
1:28:04
asking what they want all three of the adults look at me then towards the woods
1:28:09
as another rock sails out and picks Bessie in the back as she runs for the house our parents get in uncle leaves
1:28:16
mom cleans up the cuts better and our father beats the [ __ ] out of me with a fishing rod for not trying to help my
1:28:22
sister I tell him what she did and I get beat again for back-talking then sent to
1:28:28
my room that's the end but whenever Bessie would be outside near the woods
1:28:33
branches and rocks would get thrown at her heart this happened after the first
1:28:39
frost of o-6 so it was late October if I remember correctly the neighbors had
1:28:45
bought their two sons each a 22 rifle because they'd wanted to squirrel and rabbit hunt my mom bought a little break
1:28:52
action for 10 for my sister to do the same and I had a little 22 I'd bought for myself just to target shoot with and
1:28:59
maybe hunt with I know I had no intentions to try and use the thing for a shooting at the elves and I'm almost
1:29:06
positive the others didn't either we'd already did a few little hunts during the day
1:29:11
so we were fairly ok at it at the point this occurs and we were all decent shots
1:29:16
with my sister being the best of us for whatever reason we all decided to do a
1:29:21
little campout in a small bowl shaped Hollow right on the edge of our backyard so we were pretty close to our house if
1:29:28
we had to get away or something bad happened we had two little tents one for
1:29:33
each pair of siblings a sleeping bag for each of us our weapons ammo a first-aid
1:29:39
kit water containers for each of us matches and two flashlights the day
1:29:45
before we were to set off for our little adventure our father took off on one of his trips and our mom had set off
1:29:52
looking for him both our other sisters went to friends houses for the weekend leaving just
1:29:58
Marie and myself there we let the neighbors know that but they were still cool with it happening since we'd still
1:30:05
be close to the house so Saturday morning comes along we're all packed up
1:30:10
head out and set up our camp set up an area for the fire and gather wood and
1:30:15
kindling then head out to see if we can bag some squirrel or rabbit the morning
1:30:20
hunt went pretty ok each of us packing at least one kill a piece and nothing out of the ordinary happening but that
1:30:27
was usually the case early in the morning we head back to our camp and set about skinning and cleaning our kills
1:30:34
congratulating each other we dig a hole once we're done and bury the guts plug
1:30:39
it back up clean up then Marie and I said about cooking the meat and heating up some canned veggies we brought with
1:30:45
us while the neighbor boys let's call the oldest will and the younger David start setting the skins up for drying
1:30:52
they love keeping them so their grandpa could use them for making moccasins and other stuff things are going great we're
1:31:00
all having a good time and enjoying the time away from our parents and in Marie and my case other siblings we finish
1:31:08
cooking eat then set the cans from the veggies up out in the woods between 15 to 20 meters out and start having a
1:31:15
little competition shooting we do that until a little after one so we gather up
1:31:20
what was left of the cans head refill mo then decide to go exploring
1:31:26
the woods because we were feeling pretty badass with the guns and a stomach full of food plus it was usually sunny out we
1:31:33
ended up saying [ __ ] it and rolling through Joe's land cutting a path right down the middle of his one property
1:31:39
while skirting his wide-open one we also took a wide berth around the pond for
1:31:45
reasons I'll explain in a later story cut across the driveway and pushed up toward a part of the woods none of us
1:31:51
had been before the thing about this part of the woods was that it was a little thicker and mostly filled with
1:31:57
close together pines so it wasn't as lit as the rest of the place we're figuring
1:32:03
we can get a few rabbits in there for dinner and maybe make a stew of them so we set off a little deeper into it and
1:32:09
start trying to look for signs that what we were hunting went through there regularly we end up spending a good
1:32:15
three three and a half hours looking and waiting but ended up empty-handed so we
1:32:21
start making our way out of there we're almost out of there when will goes piss to get our attention and we turn to see
1:32:28
he's pointing at a rabbit maybe 30 yards out I should clarify the last bit when I
1:32:34
say out I meant it was inside the thicket with us off to our right the thing was pretty large for a wild rabbit
1:32:41
so we all agreed it would make up for the dry spell while we'd been waiting we
1:32:46
didn't want to [ __ ] up and miss so I passed the rifle to Marie who knelt shouldered it took a few deep breaths
1:32:53
sided up then squeezed the trigger her shot hit true and the rabbit dropped
1:33:00
like a rock and there were congratulations as we walked over to check out the kill the rabbit was I'd
1:33:06
say a good twenty two pounds four was a little lighter than other rabbits and it had a single streak of gray that went
1:33:13
straight down its head if I can get in touch with the neighbor guys I'll see if either they or their dad has it still
1:33:19
for pictures Marie collects her kill and stores it in her game bag and we set off
1:33:25
back to camp a little lighter in spirits since we'd gotten a meal for the evening we ended up getting two more on the way
1:33:31
back so our day was going extremely well giving each other [ __ ] like to telling jokes and waxing
1:33:38
philosophical like kids sometimes do it was about 5:30 ish when we'd got back to
1:33:44
the camp the Sun was low on the horizon so while Murray said about getting the kill skinned and cleaned we'll started
1:33:51
building a fire David went around collecting more wood for the night and I ran up to our house because I'd
1:33:57
forgotten the damn stew pot and tripod takes me about ten minutes to get up to
1:34:03
the house and back because I checked the phone to make sure our mom hadn't called took a quick [ __ ] then collected the
1:34:09
supplies by the time I got back the fire was going nicely and we'll and David
1:34:15
were assisting with the skinning and cleaning I get the tripod and pot set up they finish up I start cooking while
1:34:22
they bury the guts and start the skins we're all still going with the jokes while I cook and Murray pulled out a
1:34:29
harmonica she always carried and started playing it normal camp stuff food gets done and we
1:34:37
eat our fill take the pot off the fire to save and we all sat around having a
1:34:42
good time I'd say it's close to 8:00 now the moon is out in force and there's not a cloud
1:34:48
in the sky so the woods are pretty well lit by night standards we'll starts up with a
1:34:54
game we use to play and we all start laughing when we hear something off to our left atop the hill that overlooked
1:34:59
the campsite we all jerk our heads up in reaction and we stare up but don't see
1:35:05
anything because the height and angle we figure it's a rabbit out on a night stroll and go back to talking but we're
1:35:12
doing it a little softer than before we hear it again again we look up and see
1:35:17
nothing and we laugh it off but we all kind of forced it we do get our guns
1:35:22
though and now we're sitting there almost whispering when we hear it again but it doesn't stop when we look not
1:35:29
until it gets to the edge we still don't see anything but then we start hearing
1:35:34
something move to our right and our attention shifts the noise stops and
1:35:39
then we hear something from our back the one on the side of Joe's property attention shifts again we all whisper to
1:35:48
keep a separate eye on them so we pick a spot a piece and keep an eye on it and for a little that keeps it
1:35:54
from starting but then they all start up and get to about 25 meters out and stop
1:35:59
all except the cliff one it just had a few more join it we start hearing
1:36:04
scratching noises and little figures start popping up in the trees at the 25 meter mark we all four instantly know
1:36:12
what's up rifles and shotguns get grabbed but not raised we see that some
1:36:18
of them are holding rocks and large sticks so up come the guns and we take aim the ones with weapons rear them back
1:36:25
like they're gonna throw and we all freeze each group waiting to see who starts it Murray whispers something
1:36:32
about what we should do and I say we should stay where we are because who knows what the hell is going to happen
1:36:37
if we move a good hour passes like this before we start hearing noises slowly
1:36:42
coming towards us so Murray backs up because she's facing the rear grabs a stick out of the fire and tosses it out
1:36:50
to see if she can see what it is on her and she said it was about 10 of them crawling on the ground and they were
1:36:56
about 15 meters out she raises her shotgun and takes aim and the things
1:37:02
freeze then scurry back to the 25 meter line will takes a quick moment to toss
1:37:08
some more wood on the fire then turns back to his side I'm switching between right rear and left because I figure
1:37:16
they won't come from the front it was right on the edge of the open field and trying to think of a way to get the hell
1:37:22
out of the situation without having to shoot a fuckload of wood ELPS and more than likely getting murdered by a mess I
1:37:28
Braun wave of shrieking stuff we stayed like that another three hours will
1:37:34
periodically feeding the fire us occasionally throwing a torch out when we hear movement and them attempting to
1:37:41
get closer to us once getting to about eight meters before Murray threw a few more torches out to scare them off a
1:37:47
little after 12:00 we hear a car pull into our driveway and Murray and I look
1:37:52
at each other because we know it's our mom she starts calling out names and we start yelling for her to bring the car
1:37:59
around back right now I guess she heard something in our voice because we hear the car crank up and her
1:38:04
speed down the driveway and to the back the headlights hitting our campsite we
1:38:10
see the Alps scatter from the trees and we yell for our mom to stay there with the lights on as we start packing our
1:38:16
[ __ ] up and putting the fire out we start backpedaling out of the woods our guns up just in case and walk up to the
1:38:23
house our mom drives around front and comes in asking what happened we explain
1:38:30
it to her she gets quiet a little bit and then says there were a few in the trees around the left side of the house
1:38:36
which is why she had called our names we all stay up all night and in the morning
1:38:42
our mom runs the boys back to their place Marie and I take our guns and head back down to the campsite to make sure
1:38:49
the fire was out and to see if we could find any trace of the elves only evidence anything happened were the burn
1:38:56
torches we'd thrown out and small spots of the ground cleared of leaves like something had been laying there and had
1:39:01
gotten up in a hurry we didn't camp out in there again and now my daughter's awake and I got to
1:39:08
take care of her I'll try and post another one later which one would y'all like how tall were
1:39:15
these things been following this post all weekend and man this is a riveting story they look like they belong to
1:39:22
nature or our nature elementals between four to six inches sometimes a little
1:39:28
bigger the pond was only about 10 11 foot in
1:39:36
length and maybe eight wide but it was about 15 foot deep which was dead center of the pond and almost no shallow end it
1:39:44
was literally just a 15-foot deep hole in a rough cone shape there was an old zip line above it with the piece you
1:39:51
hold on to to stop exactly halfway over it according to will and David's dad and
1:39:57
his brothers it was like that because when they were younger they'd put it across and one day they'd been playing
1:40:03
and it had been Bill's turn to ride it he'd gotten halfway across it when it
1:40:08
had froze up and he fell into the lake and hit the side of it which was the cause of his paralysis his brothers
1:40:15
jumped in and got him out then ran home to get their parents leaving him there alone Bill told me this next part a
1:40:22
little while before he died because he knew I liked knowing about the place and he had once promised to tell me why he
1:40:28
had his nephews and I just swear we'd stay away from the place after his brothers had left he'd been laying there
1:40:35
on his back when he'd heard the sound of something coming out of the water from where he was he couldn't see what it was
1:40:41
but he said that whatever it was had started laughing softly with a gurgling sounding throat he heard footsteps come
1:40:49
near him then suddenly the trees had wood elves all in them and they were pissed off making a hissing noise
1:40:55
whatever it was stopped walking and made what sounded like a growl then the elves started throwing rocks and sticks at
1:41:02
whatever it was causing it to retreat soon after that he heard his father's
1:41:07
truck speeding down the driveway with the sound of sirens not too far away coming their way he said that he knew
1:41:14
the elf's were bad but whatever had come out of the lake was bad enough that the Alps didn't like it will and David
1:41:21
stayed away from it because the few times they had gone close to it they'd gotten a bad feeling like they were
1:41:27
being watched and the water would look like something was moving around just beneath the surface the one time I
1:41:33
decided to go take a look at it I threw a fairly large rock into it and moments later a burst of bubbles rose to the
1:41:39
surface like an air pocket had escaped Marie stayed away from it simply because she couldn't swim and was afraid
1:41:46
of deep water another weird thing about the thing was no matter how much it rained or how dry it had been it always
1:41:53
stayed the same depth and before you asked how I know that if I never went near it you could see it from the
1:41:59
driveway when you were walking Christmas of o3 I got my first pellet rifle and
1:42:06
Murray got a BB gun we're home that night after visiting our grandparents moms at work our father is gone fishing
1:42:14

1:42:30

1:42:36
point my pellet gun at him and Bessie hides Marie is standing with me with her BB gun guy runs round back and tries
1:42:44
there we run into the kitchen and do the same as the living-room guy hears sirens

1:43:27

1:44:08
of the night was quiet since the last thread reached its limit here's the new
1:44:13
thread like a few anons asked for feel free to ask whatever questions you'd
1:44:18
like and I'll try to answer them as best as I can plus tell a few stories as I
1:44:24
hear them from my sisters / neighbor kids how many people would you say knew
1:44:29
about the wood elfs and all the mysterious events that had happened and any more stories about the pond
1:44:36
altogether I would say between 18 to 20 because of the neighbors parents and
1:44:41
their brothers had a few friends who knew of them I don't have any more stories about the pond yet haven't
1:44:47
gotten a response from will I was actually wondering about your daughter did you end up getting married to the
1:44:54
girlfriend you mentioned in the one story or is this a separate thing also has she your daughter had any
1:45:01
supernatural experiences no this is a separate thing altogether her mother and
1:45:07
I aren't even on talking terms nor does she have anything to do with her as per the wishes of her mom she has the normal
1:45:14
four-year-old experiences with monsters under her bed and an imaginary friend she calls mr. bean but that's all as far
1:45:21
as I know fire story it is well it isn't much of a
1:45:27
story but it's what I could get out of Marie and she admittedly didn't remember too much about it she was home from
1:45:35
school sick our mom was at work and our father was passed out in their room like
1:45:40
the lazy [ __ ] he was she went out to take her dog for a walk walked him down to the back field he
1:45:47
started barking and jerked his leash out of her hand and started chasing something comes running out a few
1:45:53
minutes later scared and Marie sees a few elves in the trees she gets pissed
1:45:58
off runs up to the house and grabs a Gascon and a lighter takes it back down makes a few makeshift torches and throws
1:46:06
them at the elves the torches miss hit some dry grass and set an area of the
1:46:11
field slash woods on fire she freaks out and runs inside to wake our father who calls 911 the fire fire department comes
1:46:21
out and does their job Marie gets her ass beat for trying to burn the woods down and the elves stop messing with us
1:46:27
for a few months so I was wrong about will and David being a part of it story
1:46:35
time I'm gonna try and keep them short tonight guys these are a few that Marie
1:46:41
told me so they're all from her perspective first one she told me
1:46:46
happened the last year we lived there it was summer and she was walking up the driveway during the day to go hang out
1:46:53
with will and David mostly David because she had a crush on him nothing happens during the walk up there
1:47:00
because it's day she gets to their house and ends up staying until a few hours after nightfall because they were all
1:47:06
playing something she goes to leave realizes it's dark out and asks will and
1:47:12
David's parents if they'll give her a ride down unfortunately they can't because their dad's brother has the car
1:47:17
and he's at work so Marie borrows a flashlight and a bat gathers her courage
1:47:23
and starts walking down the driveway will and David's dogs following her until she hits the curve in the driveway
1:47:29
that's pretty much the end of the neighbor's driveway and turns into the main one she's walking and whistling to
1:47:36
herself so that doesn't get too spooked and it works for a little she gets past the area with the
1:47:42
abandoned house and the small barn I hid in thinks she's in the clear and starts to relax a little because that spot
1:47:49
always freaked her out the most she keeps going gets near the area with the
1:47:54
pond and starts hearing something stirring the pond up this scares her because as long as we live there she'd
1:48:01
never heard anything mess with it so she starts speeding up she said when she got
1:48:06
parallel with the pond she heard a wet plop sound what she described as what a soaking wet towel sounds like when you
1:48:13
smack it against a wall and that's followed by groaning for some reason she
1:48:18
stops and looks over with the light to see if she can see anything doesn't so she flicks it off and starts walking
1:48:25
again she's about 15 feet from the spot the noises are coming from when she
1:48:30
hears something whisper her name but she described it like someone talking through water like it was frothy and
1:48:36
full of bubbles she stops looks around with the light again see something
1:48:42
shuffling through the brush and trees near the pond she doesn't get a good look at it but then she starts hearing a
1:48:48
lot of something moving through the trees higher up and moving toward her fest she starts speed walking casting
1:48:55
the flashlight beam around and every now and then she catches a glimpse of a few wood helps in the trees heading toward
1:49:01
whatever was moving in the trees about then according to her she starts hearing
1:49:07
big rocks and branches hitting something wet and then a watery scream that she described as whatever it was being
1:49:14
extremely pissed off she takes off running for home gets to where the farm
1:49:19
is and stops to catch her breath since the house is right there where she can see it she hears something thudding
1:49:26
through the trees along the creek coming fast shines the light down the road where it's coming from and sees it hit
1:49:32
something that's slightly reflective like it's slimy or wet the trees in the
1:49:37
area start going crazy with movement the two dogs we had outside start going nuts
1:49:42
and she takes off the rest of the way home she gets inside panting and
1:49:47
red-faced our mom asks her what the hell happened and she tells her something was
1:49:52
chasing her our mom gets quiet for a little bit sends her to her room and goes out to
1:49:58
check with the big spotlight we had and her pistol meanwhile the dogs are still going nuts she's outside for a bit comes
1:50:07
inside locks the front door tells Murray not to go back outside that night that's
1:50:13
the end of that one burning white sage or any nature [ __ ] will not stop nature

the hands of man may that which is formed be now unformed this is like nuking the little [ __ ] why the [ __ ]
1:50:47
would I do that it sounds more likely to piss them off bad enough for them to try finding me
1:50:53
plus I'm not gonna litter in the woods I'm an [ __ ] but not that big an [ __ ] also just got home from work
1:51:01
about 10 minutes ago and catching up with my daughter then it'll be story time how's your
1:51:07
daughter faring after the nightmares keep us updated on her she's not doing
1:51:13
too good my girlfriend told me that when she picked her up from daycare the lady
1:51:18
there told her that she'd woken up screaming during nap time I asked her about it and she said that the scary man
1:51:25
had come in her dream and tried chasing her this is not okay physical people I
1:51:31
can scare or beat the hell out of when they mess with my little girl but demons and [ __ ] I can't do jack [ __ ]
1:51:36
about hence why I asked about things to do to banish stuff like that so when he
1:51:42
shows up do you feel anything like a sort of presence or is it just like there's another person in the room I
1:51:49
posted a little while back about my experience and as goofy as it sounds you
1:51:55
might just have to tell it to leave for every time my family has encountered demons and such we haven't done anything
1:52:02
except believe that we are given the power to cast them out and then cast them out I really wish I knew more so that if
1:52:08
there is another way I could help but for all these years I've only ever believed in that truth since I haven't
1:52:14
been proven wrong not that I'd want to I want to live a normal life as much as the next guy I guess if you try the
1:52:21
stuff from the rest of these guys and it doesn't work you can give it a shot I don't exactly know what your beliefs are
1:52:28
but I've always thought that if these things are real then God is as well but it's understandable if you have doubts
1:52:35
I've been praying nightly to keep my distance from anything like this ever again and our house has been clean best
1:52:43
of luck to you when it shows up in person or whatever you'd call it yet you
1:52:49
do feel like something is there I might get my girlfriend to take my daughter to her house tomorrow and I'll go through
1:52:55
my place and try it and burn the sage when a friend brings some by she
1:53:00
apparently is well-versed in stuff like this so I'll ask her as well and thanks for the well-wishes mate
1:53:07
they mean a lot even if you are in a nun could be some witch coven type [ __ ] any
1:53:12
history of that sort of thing in your area Beelzebub horned demon
1:53:18
proto-elamite 3,000 to 2800 BC main article Christian teaching about the
1:53:24
devil New Testament there is an implied connection between Satan and Beelzebub Lord of the Flies originally a Semitic
1:53:32
deity called Vail Lord Beelzebub is the most recognized demon in the Bible whose
1:53:38
name has become analogous to Satan a cult and metaphysical author Michelle Bellinger beliefs that Beelzebub a
1:53:45
mockery of the original name is the Horned God Bale headed whose cult symbol
1:53:50
was the bull according to the encyclopedia of witches witchcraft and Wicca Beelzebub reigned over the witches
1:53:57
Sabbath synagogue ax and that which is denied Christ in his name and chanted Beelzebub as they danced main article
1:54:05
b-cell Bob later mythology Beelzebub was also imagined to be sowing his influence
1:54:11
in Salem Massachusetts his name came up repeatedly during the Salem witch trials the last large scale
1:54:18
public expression of which hysteria in North America or Europe and afterwards Rev Cotton Mather wrote a pamphlet
1:54:25
entitled of Beelzebub in his plot not that I know of unless some witches or
1:54:31
whatever did [ __ ] around here back when Old Salem was around hate to be rude but
1:54:36
how does Old Salem correlate to your Salem you're in North Carolina the Salem
1:54:42
witch trials took place in Salem Massachusetts no there's a part of
1:54:47
winston-salem called Old Salem that goes back to colonial times after reading
1:54:54
some of the [ __ ] below these bastards could have brought anything from the Czech Republic over with them conjured
1:55:00
something up or the archeological excavations they are doing may have stirred up some [ __ ] or not but enemies
1:55:08
seem old mate Salem was founded in 1766 by the Moravians a Protestant religious
1:55:15
group that first organized in what is now known as the Czech Republic in the 15th century the Moravians were active
1:55:22
missionaries who established an earlier settlement in Bethlehem Pennsylvania before settling wachovia in the North
1:55:29
Carolina back country in 1755 in the Wachovia tract of nearly 100,000 acres
1:55:36
Salem was developed as the central administrative spiritual craft and
1:55:41
professional town surrounded by five outlying congregations the town of Salem
1:55:47
has a rich and deep history with the restoration supported by many different sources of historical documentation and
1:55:53
research core material is the primary source information published in the records of the Moravians in North
1:56:00
Carolina based on records held by the Moravian archives southern province in winston-salem
1:56:05
in addition documentation such as private papers historic photographs and
1:56:11
artistic renderings as well as ongoing research of buildings objects and archaeological resources have been
1:56:18
critical to understanding the town's history so there might be some Czech Blackmagic
1:56:24
[ __ ] going on or some ancient Czech wood spirits over there should mate it's
1:56:29
as possible as the rest of it probably they were missionaries so who knows what they were peddling could ask those folks
1:56:36
about skull guy the Celts had cirno knows maybe this is one of theirs time for another story
1:56:44
from Murray this one involves Bessie as well it's about two weeks after Murray
1:56:50
walked home from the neighbors she's outside shooting her BB gun I'm working
1:56:55
moms at work as well our father was some [ __ ] where and the oldest sister was
1:57:01
at her boyfriends leaving Bessie to babysit Murray though she barely needed it Bessie comes outside to yell at
1:57:09
Murray to come inside and help her clean the kitchen like our mom asked Bessie to do Murray tells her to [ __ ] off and do
1:57:15
it by herself like she's supposed to be doing and goes back to shooting Bessie comes out and snatches the rifle
1:57:23
from her throws it a few feet away and starts screaming at her to get her ass inside and do what she says before she
1:57:29
calls our mom and tells her that Murray wasn't listening to her Murray doesn't take kindly to being yelled at by
1:57:36
someone like Bessie so she hits her and they start fighting this goes on for
1:57:41
about three minutes when they both stop because they feel like they're being watched they both look up and into the
1:57:47
field across from the house and there are a few dozen ELPS in the trees just watching them fight and Bessie getting
1:57:53
her ass kicked Bessie still pissed off at Murray and now at the elves walks over and snatches
1:58:00
up the BB gun takes aim and pulls the trigger and actually hits one of the elves it falls from the tree squeaking
1:58:07
there's about five seconds of everyone just standing there then the woods go ballistic in a repeat
1:58:14
of the snowball incident stones and branches start getting thrown out at Bessie and Murray says [ __ ] this and
1:58:20
takes off to the house Bessie cranks off three more bb's into the woods before she drops the gun and takes off after
1:58:27
Murray the entire way being chased by stones and sticks the to get inside and
1:58:33
locked the door the dogs are going allistic at this point and they grab them and hide in my room I'd sort
1:58:39
aborted my window up guess they thought the elves couldn't get in the window and waited while they were sitting there
1:58:46
they started hearing things hit the roof and the outside walls like someone was throwing rocks at the house an hour or
1:58:53
so passes like that and Murray says that Bessie should go grab the phone so they could call our mom and let her know what
1:59:00
was going on Bessie runs to the living room to grab the phone and Murray hears her scream
1:59:05
about the time she hears something break through the bay window in the living room she runs out the dogs going nuts
1:59:12
and finds Bessie in a corner and a huge stone laying in the middle of the floor shards of the window scattered around it
1:59:19
Murray picks up the phone calls our mom and tells her what's happening and mom
1:59:25
says she's on the way Murray hangs up and asks Bessie what had happened and Bessie refused to tell her so Murray
1:59:32
pushed and pushed until she finally did according to her she'd walked into the
1:59:38
living room for the phone and had saw movement outside she looked out and about six elves were holding Mary's BB
1:59:45
gun on the porch while another one was bashing it with the huge stone they all looked up saw Bessie shrieked then the
1:59:53
one with the stone threw it through the window at Bessie I don't know why they didn't go in after her but they didn't
2:00:00
mom gets home and sees the wrecked gun and window figures Bessie got mad at
2:00:05
Murray for some reason and messed it up and that Murray had chased her with the rock and threw it at her from outside
2:00:11
the two girls swore up and down that they hadn't done it and that neither of them could have thrown the rock because
2:00:18
it was so big mom has been both try and lifted but of course they don't and she
2:00:23
figures they're just playing so she tries to do it herself and gets it up but it takes her a lot of effort to do
2:00:30
so she figures then that they're telling the truth calls a window place to have
2:00:35
them come take measurements and put a new one in she tells the two of them not to say anything to our father about it
2:00:42
and that she'll get a new BB gun pretty much Bessie stopped going outside at that house unless she had to
2:00:48
and Marie stopped shooting outside unless I was with her or she was shooting in the front yard with people
2:00:53
home mom covered it up smoothly with our Father so he never found out about it because
2:00:59
if he had he'd have beaten both the girls and mom because of it I'm gonna check on my daughter then see if I have
2:01:06
time for one or two more has your daughter been seeing him recently or is she just too scared to sleep when was
2:01:14
the last time she saw Skullhead she woke up Tuesday night crying because she saw
2:01:19
it in her dreams she hasn't woken up tonight but she's tossing and turning an
2:01:24
awful lot where normally she sleeps like the dead hello everyone sorry for not
2:01:32
posting anything yesterday had a few things come up that needed my undivided attention so I'll post a quick update
2:01:40
for y'all one I could not get up there today the friend that was supposed to
2:01:45
come with decided it would be a great time to catch the stomach flu so I'm asking around the rest of my friends for
2:01:51
a replacement for tomorrow if I can't I'm gonna end up going it alone again
2:01:57
the demon decided to show up in both my daughter and i's dreams last night but
2:02:02
i'm pretty sure that at least in my case it was because i was thinking about it it's gone from chasing my daughter in
2:02:09
her dreams to just being barely out of sight and watching her as a just in case I'm contacting some Catholic churches
2:02:16
around here to see if any of them would send someone over to bless our place to know if it'll work but I remember one a
2:02:24
nun suggested it hey everyone it's been
2:02:31
awhile since I last talked about the [ __ ] that was going on with my daughter having the nightmares involving a demon
2:02:37
that some would haunted my sisters and I when we lived in a certain house as children some of you may recall that
2:02:43
after visiting the house the demon started showing up in my daughter's dreams and either just watching her or
2:02:49
actively chasing her I should mention that I never talked about the demon around her so I was understandably
2:02:56
caught off guard when she described it perfectly I did as some of you suggested
2:03:02
found a Catholic priest that agreed to baptize her and that occurred around January 19th as heartfelt as y'all
2:03:09
suggestion was it didn't help it only really made things worse
2:03:14
now she wakes up screaming but doesn't remember the dream she stopped wanting
2:03:20
to sleep unless I let her sleep with me and even then it's pretty damn fitful he
2:03:26
started showing up more in my dreams as well but I can pretty much chalk that up to me having him on the mind a lot
2:03:32
recently my therapist had me start keeping a dream journal as a way to help keep track of dreams plus it helps me
2:03:40
remember some of the stuff I blanked out as a kid nothing big yet but a few
2:03:45
interesting things have shown up anyways do y'all have any more ideas that I could try to get rid of him up
2:03:52
here Jesus I didn't think this would still be going but I have an update I
2:03:59
had to pick her up early from daycare today one of the workers there forced
2:04:04
her to take a nap and ten minutes in she woke up screaming and flailing about hard enough that she gave one of the
2:04:10
assistants a nosebleed when I asked her about it she said that the skull man had
2:04:16
asked her if she wanted to come with him she says she kept telling it no and that
2:04:21
each time it would get more and more irate with her until it finally grabbed her and that's when she woke up she
2:04:27
seems okay right now but it's got me nervous as for the suggestions I'm
2:04:33
seeing about making slash getting her a dreamcatcher we're already way ahead of you there by about a year nice to see
2:04:40
you're out and about again Nick unfortunately if any attempts of protection have failed then you're only
2:04:47
cause of solution is to absolutely ignore and forget this demon do not communicate with it do not try to
2:04:54
bargain with it if it appears in any context whether in dream or in real life
2:04:59
do not acknowledge it it manifests through fear eliminate the fear and it
2:05:05
will starve teach your daughter to ignore the skull man help her to forget him he will do nearly
2:05:12
anything to keep that fear over your head do not give in delete and burn any
2:05:18
mention of his existence get rid of any evidence of his presence it's easier
2:05:24
said than done I can't really get rid of the notes my therapist has on it but I
2:05:29
can try the rest I mean hell it can't possibly make matters any worse than they already are
2:05:34
and since some of you requested I found a pic of a skull close to the one demon
2:05:40
bro wears as a head pic related just add scorching and dirt to the bone and the
2:05:45
horns would be more damaged like they'd been used to beat against something
