                    <p>Overall: the world will end.  Start with player saving food production for their nation.  This introduces the mechanics, of course, and the player dies at the end.  This same device that the player dies for is what kills the entire planet in the end.</p><p>The main arch of the story involves a childish leader of a nation defending their country (and pride) from an unseen foreign threat.  Both sides have world devastating devices at their disposal.</p><p>Player’s character never has a real place in the story. General story takes place with or without them, but they do have influence.  If player lives long and sees many interactions, characters that they spend time with will become attached to them.  If player dies regularly, characters may still remember key scenes and reflect confidence/reluctance based on past actions.  A confident character will play a stronger role in the story.</p><p>Possible main characters and story angles:</p><ul><li>The right-hand man: Loyal and fully trusts the leader.  Genuinely thinks their side is in the right and must defend their ideals at any cost.<br/></li><li>The princess and the spy:  Tragic love story.</li><li>the ruined prisoner: possible horror story, prisoner branded traitor for wanting peace between the nations, eventual martyr.</li></ul>
