I decided to try and do Sickly Wizard&rsquo;s awesome environment tutorial for ps1 graphics ( <a href="https://youtu.be/NcmO6Sxmq14" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/NcmO6Sxmq14</a> ).  Seems very approachable.  Of course the 15 minute tutorial took me 10 hours to do.  Further exasperated by the fact that it took days for me to think of a scene I even wanted to model.  I didn&rsquo;t even technically finish the tutorial because I didn&rsquo;t do any of the vertex lighting stuff.  I really wanted to be done, and this is a start I guess.  I&rsquo;ll do something different next time&hellip; With a lot less polygons.  I need to choose better textures, it&rsquo;s so easy to want to focus on a feature in the texture, but those identifiable features are what kill the repeatability.  I also can&rsquo;t seem to stop over working my models.  Way too much rounding on the boulders, yet but enough on the walls and ceiling.  Hopefully I&rsquo;ll have some other models to actually populate a scene with next time.  Plants and rocks type stuff. Now that I&rsquo;ve got some exposure to the method, hopefully I can scale back my goals a bit more.</p>
