Simple, cute, amusing point and click. Fun story and characters. I loved playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/58200/Jolly_Rover/" target="_blank">Jolly Rover</a>.<br/><br/>The game is really tight and everything works well. However, there are some extra things needed for 100% completion that you really have to guess at in order to accomplish. You need to click everything in every scene twice before you move on to a new area of story because you can&rsquo;t go back, and that doesn&rsquo;t guarantee that you&rsquo;ll find everything, because there&rsquo;s no reason for a lot of it. It adds a little replay-ability because it&rsquo;s a short game, but that&rsquo;s a cheap tactic.<br/><br/>This is a pretty easy and short game. If you are a hardcore point &amp; click gamer who wants a challenge and for some reason you paid full price for this game, you&rsquo;ll probably feel pretty ripped off. But for me this game was great fun.
