                                    <h1>My Girlfriend Flies Away from Me</h1>
                    <p>     My girlfriend has gone on vacation with her family for 5 days.  This should be a very normal thing and many people seem to congratulate me on some kind of freedom, but I don&rsquo;t feel that way.</p>
<p>    I&rsquo;ve got anxiety issues.  I&rsquo;ve had them for longer than I&rsquo;ve known her.  It&rsquo;s the kind of anxiety that I used to get as a child when I knew that I was going to the doctor to get a needle.  It sticks between my stomach and my heart and often overflows into tears.  While I eventually learned to keep my cool until the shot was done and I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about being scared of it anymore, these days I don&rsquo;t know when the anxiety will be finished.  Yes, my girlfriend is coming home.  I talk to her every day and she tells me &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be home soon&rdquo;.  It&rsquo;s true, she will be, I will feel better, but the words and the comfort just seems to float through me and I&rsquo;m still scared. </p>
<p>     I&rsquo;m not writing this to complain, I&rsquo;m not trying to boast about my problems.  I just feel better when I write.  Like maybe I can understand what&rsquo;s going on if I can break it down just right.</p>
<p>     I don&rsquo;t know the root of my anxiety.  I blame it on different fundamental problems and I&rsquo;m trying to narrow down what exactly is the cause.  Overworked?  Too much free time?  Bad social habits?  Loneliness?  I don&rsquo;t know.  I probably never will or at least the reason will keep changing.</p>
<p>     This week I watched my girlfriend fly away from me and it bothers me.  This is the third time in the last 9 months that she&rsquo;s done this.  She hasn&rsquo;t done it willingly and I&rsquo;m not blaming anyone.  Things just happen and it&rsquo;s always logical that she leaves without me. </p>
<p>     What I think bothers me about this is the fact that I&rsquo;ve only flown 4 times in my life.  It&rsquo;s not an issue with quantity but three times now she&rsquo;s flown away from me and it bothers me.  She tells me apologetically that soon we&rsquo;ll go places together.  I want that but even that isn&rsquo;t the issue.</p>
<p>     That will be great but right now I think what&rsquo;s bothering me is how I feel so left behind. Not specifically because of this event but maybe it&rsquo;s a more difficult and extreme feeling since I have a week to dwell on it alone.  I feel like a kid that was standing in line while my peer captains picked teams and rather than being the last kid picked; I wasn&rsquo;t acknowledged at all and the game started without me.  I&rsquo;m right here but things keep happening without me and it feels like I&rsquo;m the only one left alone.</p>
<p>    Right now I think I&rsquo;d feel better if I were the one getting on the plane and she was the one who had to miss me.  There&rsquo;s something wrong with this.  Not just the fact that I&rsquo;d rather her suffer this way, this time, there&rsquo;s something logically wrong with it.  I know she misses me right now, she tells me and I know it&rsquo;s true.  I want to think that if our physical positions were changed, so will our emotional ones.</p>
<p>     Realistically though, if I were on the plane and she stayed behind, she would miss me, exactly how she does now.  She&rsquo;ll carry on and she&rsquo;ll miss me.  If I was on a plane; I&rsquo;d be anxious and scared, trying to write my feelings out because it bothers me.</p>
