It&rsquo;s super sharp, especially with ice.  I&rsquo;ve gone through most of the bottle by now and I&rsquo;m regretting drinking it with ice so often&hellip; Including this time.  I had a taste as soon as I poured it and I thought the whiskey had aged since I last had it.  Now its settled and it tastes like the other times.  For a brief second there it was more bold and full bodied with a slightly peat ending.  Almost Dark Horse like (my absolute favorite). I&rsquo;ll have to remember that next pour.</p>

<p>It came with a custom glass! Which has fast become a favorite of mine.  Fat bottom glass make my rockin world go round.</p> </div>
