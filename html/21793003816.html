                                    <h1>My Initial Responce to 5-HTP</h1>
                    <p>This last year has been a rough one.  I developed an emotional problem that effected every aspect of my life.  Up until recently I couldn&rsquo;t pin point when I got the problem.  I&rsquo;ve always had a critical perspective on my life.  I&rsquo;ve often had troubles with loneliness and depression but I&rsquo;ve always pulled through.  This year however, for the entire year, that didn&rsquo;t feel to be the case.  I figured it was just a build up of all the depression spirals of my life swelling to a final climax.  More than once I was certain that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to allow myself to survive through the night. </p>
<p>A particular tough night that I had last week brought me to Google for help.  My therapist had told me before that it&rsquo;s Adrenaline that makes me feel this way and I just need to calm down and put things into perspective.  I&rsquo;ve calmed my way through hundreds of depression spirals in my life, it just didn&rsquo;t work anymore.  So I Googled &ldquo;what stops adrenaline?&rdquo; and it didn&rsquo;t take many hits to learn about serotonin and how to get it in the form of 5-HTP.  The next day I bought a bottle and took my first pill.</p>
<p>There is an abundance of information online about what 5-HTP is, how it works, and the caution that needs to be applied to it&rsquo;s users. so I&rsquo;m not going to elaborate on that, this is just my experience from my first week of using it.  I bought a bottle of 50mg pills and I took one.  Instantly I felt calmer.  It felt like a subtle aura was growing around me and the anxiety that I had constantly felt for over a year was creeping backward.  About an hour later I took a nap.  My anxiety makes sleep difficult and at this time I didn&rsquo;t even feel particularly tired.  I just laid down and went to sleep and everything felt fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the pills for nearly a week now.  I&rsquo;ve paired them with pills of rhodiola rosea, taking 50 mg of 5-HTP in the evenings before bed and 400mg of rhodiola with breakfast in the morning.  Things have been a lot more manageable this week.  I don&rsquo;t have nearly as concrete of a feeling from taking the rhodiola, but there has been times were I&rsquo;ve noticed myself being particularly anxious and even paranoid, these feelings allowed me to recall that I hadn&rsquo;t taken my rhodiola pills that morning.  So I assume they&rsquo;re doing something good.</p>
<p>I told my therapist that I was insecure about taking medication because I didn&rsquo;t know what it would do to me.  I really didn&rsquo;t want to lose myself or feel that I was only different because of a pill.  5-HTP makes me feel like who I remember myself to be before I had chronic anxiety issues.  I still have all my feelings.  I have worries and anxieties, they just don&rsquo;t seem nearly as critical and I can even put them aside to worry about later.  On good days I used to tell my girlfriend that it just feels like my problems are farther away, somewhere in the distance, and this is consistently true when I take 5-HTP.</p>
<p>So my non medical opinion based on my first week of these drugs is: if you&rsquo;re hurting enough to consider supplements, try 5-HTP and rhodiola rosea.  My personal goal is to use them steadily together for a month then test my progress.  Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to stay off both for a while.  If not, I&rsquo;ll try doing rhodiola rosea solo and report my experience.</p>
